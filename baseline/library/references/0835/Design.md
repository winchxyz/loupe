# Rivian — Style Reference
> Electric monolith on a concrete gallery wall. Rivian stages each vehicle as a sculpture against vast white space, with typography so large it becomes architecture and one warm yellow that breaks the monochrome like sunlight on a matte surface.

**Theme:** light

Rivian presents its vehicles as monumental objects in a clean architectural gallery: white concrete canvases, full-bleed cinematic photography, and one signature Solar Yellow accent that electrifies the otherwise monochrome system. Typography does the heavy lifting — a custom Adventure typeface at near-black weights paired with Liga at 360px for product monograms makes each vehicle feel branded and indivisible. Components are minimal and confident: pill-shaped controls, hairline borders, flat surfaces, and generous negative space that lets photography breathe. Color is rationed to the single yellow CTA and a few paint-swatch accents; everything else is graphite, concrete, and white. The system rejects decoration in favor of scale, restraint, and theatrical product presentation.

## Tokens — Colors

| Name | Value | Token | Role |
|------|-------|-------|------|
| Solar Yellow | `#ffac00` | `--color-solar-yellow` | Yellow supporting accent for decorative details and low-frequency emphasis. Do not promote it to the primary CTA color |

| Slate Blue | `#9fa1b8` | `--color-slate-blue` | Cool-tinted shadow base and atmospheric wash — the only chromatic neutral, gives elevation a slightly overcast feel |
| Graphite | `#151515` | `--color-graphite` | Dark supporting neutral for text, icons, and strong contrast. Do not promote it to the primary CTA color |
| Pure Black | `#000000` | `--color-pure-black` | High-contrast text, icon fills, and the heaviest display headings where maximum weight is needed |
| Concrete | `#e5e7eb` | `--color-concrete` | Light supporting surface for subtle backgrounds and section separation. Do not promote it to the primary CTA color |
| Ash | `#cfd0d0` | `--color-ash` | Mid-gray surface and shadow base for elevated cards and subtle depth |
| Fog | `#b8b8b8` | `--color-fog` | Muted helper text and tertiary metadata |
| Steel | `#616161` | `--color-steel` | Secondary nav text, subdued icon fills, inactive labels |
| Paper | `#ffffff` | `--color-paper` | Page canvas, card surface, reversed text on dark fills |
| Chalk | `#f2f2f2` | `--color-chalk` | Alternate page background for content sections — warmer than pure white, breaks the canvas rhythm |
| Charcoal | `#212121` | `--color-charcoal` | Input field backgrounds and dark UI surfaces — slightly lighter than Graphite to read as surface rather than text |

## Components

### Solar Yellow CTA Button
**Role:** Primary action button (Demo drive, key conversions)

Pill shape at 40px radius, #ffac00 fill, #151515 text in Adventure weight 500 at 14px. Padding 12px 24px. The single chromatic button in the system — it exists to be the visual climax of any page. Never use a second yellow button on the same screen.

### Graphite Filled Button
**Role:** Primary action in sections without the yellow demo CTA (Explore vehicle)

Pill shape at 40px radius, #151515 fill, #ffffff text in Adventure weight 500 at 14px. Padding 12px 24px. The dark counterpart to Solar Yellow — used when the yellow is reserved for the demo conversion.

### Light Filled Button
**Role:** Tertiary action (Buy, secondary commerce flow)

Pill shape at 40px radius, #e5e7eb fill, #151515 text in Adventure weight 500 at 14px. Padding 12px 24px. Quiet alternative that doesn't compete with the dark or yellow primary buttons.

### Ghost Button — Light Outline
**Role:** Secondary action over photography (View all offers)

Pill shape at 40px radius, transparent fill, 1px #ffffff border, #ffffff text in Adventure weight 500 at 14px. Padding 12px 24px. Designed to sit on dark or photographic backgrounds without competing with the image.

### Ghost Button — Dark Outline
**Role:** Secondary action on light backgrounds (Shop)

Pill shape at 40px radius, transparent fill, 1px #151515 border, #151515 text in Adventure weight 500 at 14px. Padding 12px 24px. Mirrors the light ghost for use on white or chalk surfaces.

### Pill Nav Button
**Role:** Top-level navigation items and category chips

Full 9999px radius, 8px 16px padding, Adventure weight 500 at 12-14px. #151515 text. Used for primary nav links, tag chips, and filter pills. The fully rounded form contrasts with the 40px buttons to create a typology of roundness.

### Top Navigation Bar
**Role:** Global site navigation

White (#ffffff) background, 1px #e5e7eb bottom border, fixed position. Logo left (not extracted, assumed), centered nav links (Vehicles, Charging, Technology, Discover, Gear Shop) in Adventure 500 at 14px #151515, Solar Yellow Demo drive CTA right. Height approximately 60px. Minimal, airy, high-contrast.

### Hero Carousel Slide
**Role:** Full-bleed promotional hero with vehicle photography

Full viewport width, ~80vh height. Background is a full-bleed photographic image of a vehicle in an environmental context. Overlaid white headline (Adventure 500, 44-56px, -1.36 to -2.02px tracking) positioned bottom-left. Subtext at 16px weight 400. Two buttons side by side: ghost-light + filled-yellow or ghost-dark. Carousel pagination as small pill indicators centered below.

### Product Monogram Block
**Role:** R1S/R1T product identity page header

Chalk (#f2f2f2) background. Liga at 360px weight 500 in #000000, centered, with -7.92px tracking. Vehicle product photo centered below in full profile view, with no card or frame — the vehicle sits directly on the background. Tagline below at 20px weight 500 #151515, then price at 14px weight 400 #616161, then two buttons (Explore = Graphite, Buy = Light).

### Location Selector Dropdown
**Role:** Region/continent selection in nav

Dark surface (#151515) panel, white text, with +/– expand indicators. Expanded items show "North America" and "Europe" in Adventure 500 at 14px. Rounded at 12px. The dark surface in an otherwise light nav signals utility/configuration rather than marketing.

### Legal/Disclosure Text Block
**Role:** Fine print, terms, disclaimers

#e5e7eb background, full-width contained. Body text in Adventure 400 at 12px #151515 with normal tracking, line-height 1.55. Left-aligned, max-width container. Dense and utilitarian — a stark contrast to the theatrical hero above.

### Chip Tag (99px radius)
**Role:** Category labels, vehicle feature tags

Fully rounded at 99px, #e5e7eb background or #f2f2f2, #151515 text in Adventure 500 at 12px. Padding 6px 14px. Used for product categories, feature labels, and contextual tags.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use Solar Yellow (#ffac00) for exactly one primary CTA per screen — never pair it with another yellow element.
- Use 40px border-radius for all action buttons and 9999px for nav links and tag chips — these two radii define the system.
- Let photography fill the viewport edge-to-edge in hero sections; never frame vehicle images in cards on landing pages.
- Scale typography aggressively: use 56px+ for page-level headings, 120px for display moments, and 360px Liga for product monograms only.
- Set letter-spacing to negative values at all sizes above 20px: -0.020em at 24px scaling to -0.045em at 120px.
- Keep most surfaces flat — use #e5e7eb hairline borders for definition rather than shadows.
- Use #f2f2f2 (Chalk) to alternate section backgrounds and break white-only monotony.

### Don't
- Do not use any chromatic color other than Solar Yellow for primary actions — the system is monochrome by design.
- Do not use shadows for elevation; use surface color shifts (#ffffff → #f2f2f2 → #e5e7eb) instead.
- Do not set body text below 12px or above 18px — the 14-16px body range is deliberate.
- Do not use rounded images above 20px radius on landing pages; the product should feel architectural, not soft.
- Do not use multiple typefaces in a single composition — Adventure handles 99% of the system; Liga is reserved for product monograms.
- Do not apply gradients to UI components; gradients in the data are atmospheric washes only, not interface decoration.
- Do not use color for hierarchy in monochrome sections — rely on weight (400 vs 500 vs 600) and size differences.

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Paper Canvas | `#ffffff` | Default page background and primary card surface |
| 2 | Chalk Section | `#f2f2f2` | Alternate section background to create rhythm on long pages |
| 3 | Concrete Border | `#e5e7eb` | Hairline dividers, button base, fine print background |
| 4 | Ash Elevation | `#cfd0d0` | Subtle elevated surface and shadow base |
| 5 | Charcoal Utility | `#212121` | Input fields and dark utility surfaces |

## Elevation

- **Cards and elevated surfaces:** `0 4px 12px rgba(159, 161, 184, 0.15)`
- **Floating panels and dropdowns:** `0 8px 24px rgba(159, 161, 184, 0.2)`

## Imagery

Photography is the dominant visual asset: full-bleed, cinematic, environmental shots of vehicles in natural and urban settings (city streets, dirt roads, twilight landscapes). Treatment is naturalistic with no duotone or heavy color grading — the vehicles appear as they are, shot at golden hour or overcast light for drama. No lifestyle people-centric framing; the vehicle is always the hero, sometimes with a single human figure for scale. Images use 20px border-radius when contained. The visual language also includes the 360px Liga monogram as a graphic element — typography that functions as art. No illustrations, no abstract graphics, no 3D renders in marketing contexts.

## Layout

Page model is full-bleed with centered max-width content containers at ~1440px. Navigation is a minimal top bar (white, fixed) with centered links and a right-aligned yellow CTA. Hero sections are full-viewport-width photographic backgrounds with text overlays positioned bottom-left. Product monogram pages use centered symmetry: massive type → centered vehicle profile → centered text stack → centered button pair. Section rhythm alternates between full-bleed photo sections and centered narrow text blocks. Content arrangement favors centered stacks over asymmetric layouts. Card grids appear for vehicle comparisons and feature listings, typically 2-3 columns with generous gutters. Dense sections (legal, specs) use constrained max-width with justified text. Spacing is generous — 80px section gaps, 24px card padding, 8px element gaps — the system breathes.

## Agent Prompt Guide

**Quick Color Reference**
- background: #ffffff (primary canvas), #f2f2f2 (alternate section)
- text: #151515 (primary), #616161 (secondary), #b8b8b8 (tertiary)
- border: #e5e7eb (hairline), #cfd0d0 (emphasis)
No distinct primary action color was observed; use the extracted neutral button treatments instead of inventing a filled CTA color.
