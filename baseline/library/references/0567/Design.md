# Peak Design — Style Reference
> Gallery wall, half lit

**Theme:** light

Peak Design is a gallery-grade commerce experience: a near-monochrome canvas where editorial typography and product photography do all the work. The system alternates between crisp white surfaces and deep near-black panels, creating dramatic split layouts where one side carries an italic serif headline and the other a full-bleed product or lifestyle image. Typography is the brand's primary voice — a tall condensed display serif (Exposure-style) for headlines paired with a neutral grotesque (Geist) for UI and an all-caps compressed sans (bryant) for labels, eyebrows, and buttons. The interface stays disciplined: no chromatic UI elements, no decorative gradients, no shadows — just hairline borders, two corner radii (4 and 8), and a single red accent reserved for rare emphasis. Components feel engineered rather than decorated: thin dividers, flat product cards, pill-shaped filter chips, and ghost buttons that read as architectural annotations.

## Tokens — Colors

| Name | Value | Token | Role |
|------|-------|-------|------|
| Carbon Ink | `#1a211e` | `--color-carbon-ink` | Primary text, dark hero panels, body copy, icons, borders on light surfaces — the near-black that anchors every headline and forms the deep-background panels of split sections |
| Paper White | `#ffffff` | `--color-paper-white` | Light supporting surface for subtle backgrounds and section separation. Do not promote it to the primary CTA color |
| True Black | `#000000` | `--color-true-black` | Maximum contrast elements: headline fills on white, announcement bar, footer treatments, solid icon strokes — appears where the design demands the sharpest edge |
| Obsidian | `#0c0c0c` | `--color-obsidian` | Deep panel surfaces and image overlays — slightly softer than true black, used for full-bleed dark sections that need to feel weighty without flat black's harshness |
| Fog | `#eef1f0` | `--color-fog` | Light supporting surface for subtle backgrounds and section separation. Do not promote it to the primary CTA color |
| Mist | `#e0e0e0` | `--color-mist` | Divider lines, disabled states, subtle structural separators — the mid-light gray that defines boundaries between sections on the white canvas |
| Graphite | `#606562` | `--color-graphite` | Muted body text, secondary navigation, metadata labels — the de-emphasized text tone for information that supports but should not compete with headlines |
| Ash Border | `#cccfcd` | `--color-ash-border` | Hairline input borders, subtle dividers — a warm-leaning gray that reads as a soft pencil line against white surfaces |
| Slate | `#363537` | `--color-slate` | Navigation text on light surfaces, mid-weight borders — reads as near-black at small sizes but carries a subtle warmth |
| Pewter | `#4e4e4e` | `--color-pewter` | Supporting neutral for secondary UI, dividers, and muted labels |
| Ember Red | `#cc2e39` | `--color-ember-red` | Red supporting accent for decorative details and low-frequency emphasis |

## Components

### Announcement Bar
**Role:** Top utility bar for promotions and links

Full-width black (#1a211e) strip, ~32px tall, white (#ffffff) text at 14px bryant weight 700 uppercase with 0.057em tracking. Content centered horizontally. Provides shipping/warranty/return info and secondary navigation entry points (store finder, mission).

### Primary Navigation
**Role:** Main site header with logo, category links, search, and account controls

White (#ffffff) background, ~64px tall, with hairline bottom border (#e0e0e0). Left: Peak Design diamond/peak logo in #1a211e. Center-left: category links in bryant 700 16px uppercase (#363537), letter-spacing 0.057em. Center: full search input field with #eef1f0 background, #cccfcd border, 4px radius, 14px Geist placeholder text in #606562. Right: Support link, account icon, cart icon — all in #1a211e. No background fill, no elevation.

### Category Filter Bar
**Role:** Horizontal scrollable product category selector

Pill-shaped filter chips below the main nav, 8px row gap between chips. Active state: #1a211 fill with #ffffff text. Inactive: transparent fill with #363537 text and #cccfcd border. Text: bryant 700 16px uppercase. Height ~40px, horizontal padding 20px, border-radius 9999px. Arrow buttons on right edge for overflow.

### Product Card
**Role:** Individual product tile in the product grid

White (#ffffff) background, no visible border. Product image fills the card top with 8px border-radius. No padding between image and text. 'New' badge: #4e4e4 pill at top-left of image, white bryant 700 14px text, padding 2px 8px, 9999px radius. Product title: Geist 400 16px #1a211, 4px gap to brand label. Brand label 'Kelp': Geist 400 14px #606562. Price: Geist 400 16px #1a211, 8px below brand label. Card has no shadow or border — content separates by whitespace alone.

### Hero Split Panel
**Role:** Full-width hero with editorial headline on one side, product image on the other

Two-column 50/50 split, full viewport width, 400-600px height. Left panel: #0c0c0c or #1a211 background with eyebrow label in bryant 700 14px white uppercase, then display headline in Exposure-style serif 48-80px italic #ffffff with -0.025em tracking, line-height 1.10. Subtext in Geist 400 16px white at 80% opacity. Right panel: full-bleed product or lifestyle image with no border-radius (flush to viewport edge). Vertical centering of text content within left panel.

### Filled Button (on dark)
**Role:** Primary action button on dark hero panels

White (#ffffff) fill, no border, 4px corner radius. Padding: 12px vertical, 20px horizontal. Text: bryant 700 16px uppercase in #1a211, letter-spacing 0.057em. No shadow, no hover state with elevation shift — the button is a solid rectangle of contrast.

### Outlined Button (on dark)
**Role:** Secondary action button on dark hero panels

Transparent fill, 1px white (#ffffff) border, 4px corner radius. Padding: 12px vertical, 20px horizontal. Text: bryant 700 16px uppercase in #ffffff, letter-spacing 0.057em. Border is thin enough to read as an annotation rather than a container.

### Ghost Button (on light)
**Role:** Text-only or borderless action on white surfaces

No background, no border. Text: bryant 700 14-16px uppercase in #1a211, letter-spacing 0.057em. Used for inline links and low-emphasis actions that should feel like annotations on the page.

### Carousel Pagination Dots
**Role:** Position indicator for scrollable product carousels

Horizontal row of 4-6 dots, 8px gap. Active dot: ~8px wide solid #1a211 rounded pill. Inactive: ~8px circle in #cccfcd. Centered below the product row.

### Search Field
**Role:** Persistent search input in the main navigation

#eef1f0 background fill, 1px #cccfcd border, 4px corner radius. Height ~40px, width fills available nav space. Left icon (magnifying glass) in #606562 at 16px. Placeholder text 'Search for packing cubes' in Geist 400 14px #606562.

### Section Heading Block
**Role:** Editorial heading for content sections like 'Explore our products'

Large display serif in #1a211, left-aligned, 48-80px size, line-height 1.10. Optional em-dash suffix (—) as a visual terminal. Appears at the top of content sections with 64px top padding from the previous section.

### Navigation Icon Button
**Role:** Account, cart, and utility icons in the header

No background, no border. Icon only at 20-24px, stroke weight 1.5px, color #1a211e. 8px padding around clickable area. No hover state with background fill — the icon darkens slightly on interaction.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use the Exposure-style serif italic only for hero and section-display headlines at 48px or larger; never for body, UI labels, or anything below 40px.
- Set body text in Geist 400 at 16px with 1.5 line-height; reserve Geist 600/700 for product names and inline emphasis only.
- Use bryant 700 uppercase with positive tracking (0.038em at 14px, 0.057em at 16px) for every navigation label, button, and eyebrow text — never set bryant in mixed case.
- Alternate between white (#ffffff) and near-black (#0c0c0c or #1a211e) full-bleed sections to create editorial split layouts; never use both tones within a single product card or form.
- Maintain 8px border-radius for all cards and product images, 4px for all buttons, inputs, and nav elements, and 9999px for all badges and filter pills.
- Use #cc2e39 Ember Red only for single-instance emphasis (a sale indicator, urgency badge, or brand punctuation); never apply it to standard buttons, links, or repeated UI elements.
- Keep product cards borderless and shadowless — separate them from the canvas with 24px+ whitespace, not with containers or elevation.

### Don't
- Do not introduce colored backgrounds for buttons, cards, or section panels — the system is deliberately monochromatic with black/white/gray only.
- Do not add box-shadow or drop-shadow to any element; the design relies on flat color contrast and hairline borders for separation.
- Do not set body or UI text in the Exposure serif — it is a display face only and loses legibility below 32px.
- Do not use mixed case with the bryant font; it is designed for compressed uppercase labels and reads as a different typeface in lowercase.
- Do not place the full-color Ember Red on more than one element per viewport; its power comes from scarcity in a grayscale system.
- Do not use rounded corners larger than 8px on cards or images, and never apply 32px or 9999px radius to anything other than buttons and badges respectively.
- Do not center-align body copy or product descriptions — the layout language is left-aligned and editorial, with centered alignment reserved for hero headlines and section labels only.

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 0 | Canvas | `#ffffff` | Primary page background for product grids, content sections, and the right side of split layouts |
| 1 | Soft Card | `#eef1f0` | Contained component backgrounds, input fields, secondary buttons — subtle lift from canvas |
| 2 | Hairline | `#e0e0e0` | Divider lines and border separators between sections and cards |
| 3 | Deep Panel | `#0c0c0c` | Full-bleed dark sections, hero panels, image overlays — dramatic contrast zones |

## Elevation

The design intentionally avoids all shadows and elevation effects. Separation between elements is achieved through flat color contrast (white vs near-black panels), hairline 1px borders in #e0e0e0 or #cccfcd, and generous whitespace. There is no z-axis in this system — everything sits on a single plane, and depth is implied by tone rather than by offset or blur.

## Imagery

Product photography dominates the visual language: bags, slings, and camera gear shot on pure white backgrounds with no lifestyle context, lit to show material texture and hardware details. Lifestyle imagery appears only in full-bleed editorial sections (e.g., hands holding cameras in a circle) and occupies the full viewport width on one side of a split panel. Images have no border-radius in hero contexts (flush to edges) and 8px radius in card contexts. No illustrations, no abstract graphics, no icon illustrations beyond functional UI icons. The product IS the hero — the photography is studio-grade, consistent angle, consistent lighting, consistent white ground, and the UI steps back to let the objects speak.

## Layout

Full-bleed page sections that alternate between white and near-black, each section spanning the full viewport width with no max-width constraint at the section level. Content within sections is max-width ~1440px and centered. The dominant hero pattern is a 50/50 split: text block (eyebrow + display headline + subtext + buttons) on one side, full-bleed product or lifestyle image on the other. Below the fold, product grids use 4 columns of equal-width product cards with generous 24-32px gaps. Category filter bars sit directly below the main nav as a horizontal row of pill chips. Section rhythm is defined by alternating light/dark bands with 80px vertical padding between sections, creating an editorial magazine cadence. Navigation is a sticky top bar with a thin announcement strip above it.

## Editorial Section Patterns

Peak Design's layout language follows three repeating section archetypes: (1) Split hero — 50/50 dark-left/text + light-right/image, with the display serif doing the work; (2) Product carousel — horizontal row of 4 product cards under a left-aligned display heading, with pagination dots below; (3) Manifesto blocks — centered or left-aligned display serif text on white, with optional em-dash terminal, followed by a single ghost or outlined button. Every full-bleed section alternates polarity (white → black → white) to maintain editorial rhythm. No section uses a gradient, image overlay with text, or colored background.
