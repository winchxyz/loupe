# 7shifts — Style Reference
> warm diner counter with neon chalk accents — a bright restaurant counter where indigo buttons, orange hand-drawn underlines, and lime highlighter marks sit on clean white and warm bone surfaces, with occasional black bands that make the colors glow.

**Theme:** light

7shifts is a light, air-kissed SaaS canvas with a single punchy indigo as the call-to-action and a small cast of warm accents doing the personality work. The page reads like a clean restaurant counter: white surface, warm bone secondary panels, soft pastel card variants, and the occasional full-bleed black band that makes everything around it feel brighter. Orange is the signature flourish — it underlines hero words in a hand-drawn stroke, floods feature backgrounds, and marks tabbed content — while a lime-green acts as highlighter text inside dark sections. Components are generous and rounded (pill buttons, 20px cards, 40px hero plates) with a compact vertical rhythm. The lone script typeface, Nanum Pen Script, shows up only as a personality accent under hero copy and never on body or UI controls.

## Components

### Primary Pill Button
**Role:** Main call-to-action — 'Get your free trial', demo requests

Filled #4570ff indigo, white text, 9999px radius (true pill), 12px vertical × 24px horizontal padding, weight 500 at 16px. Single shadow or none. This is the only filled chromatic button in the system.

### Outlined Orange Button
**Role:** Secondary action on hero or feature sections

Transparent fill, 2px #ff6808 border, #ff6808 text, 9999px radius, 10px × 20px padding. Reads as energetic, not aggressive.

### Ghost Nav Button
**Role:** Navigation link with hover affordance

Transparent fill, #555555 text at 16px weight 500, 8px vertical × 12px horizontal padding, 16px radius. Becomes filled #f1f0ec on hover.

### Login Pill Button
**Role:** Low-emphasis utility action in the header

Filled #f1f0ec warm bone, #000000 text, 9999px radius, 10px × 20px padding. Sits next to the primary indigo CTA to create a quiet/active pair.

### Content Card
**Role:** Feature cards, testimonial cards, product modules

White surface, 20px radius, 20–24px padding, optional 1px #e5e7eb hairline border. No shadow by default — the dark band context or colored fill provides the elevation.

### Colored Feature Card
**Role:** Rotating pastel/navy/forest card variant in feature grids

One of four fills — #ebdcff lavender, #d6e0ff ice blue, #c293f1 lilac, #193f78 navy, or #244f47 sage. 20px radius, 20–24px padding, white or black text depending on fill luminance. This rotation is a signature device for adding variety without breaking the system.

### Dark Comparison Card
**Role:** 'With 7shifts' side of the before/after split

Filled #000000, white text, 20px radius, 24px padding. Paired against a light bone card with the same radius to create the side-by-side contrast block.

### Hero Plate
**Role:** Full-width hero container and case-study band

Full-bleed white or dark photo, 40px radius on the top or bottom edge when transitioning into a card grid. Contains centered headline at 48–64px weight 500 with the Nanum Pen Script orange underline accent.

### Tabbed Feature Section
**Role:** Product feature showcase with switchable tabs

White background, centered heading at 36–48px, tab row with active tab marked by an indigo underline and weight 500. Content below splits into a colored feature panel (orange or pastel) on the left and white text panel on the right, both at 20px radius.

### Pill Tag / Case Study Chip
**Role:** Case study links, category tags, small badges

Filled #ffffff or #f1f0ec, #000000 text at 12–14px weight 400, 9999px radius, 4px × 12px padding. Sits beneath logo grids.

### Logo Grid
**Role:** Customer trust strip — restaurant chain logos

Horizontal row of brand logos on a dark photo background, each with a white pill 'Case study' chip beneath. No card containers; logos sit directly on the photographic surface.

### Comparison Check / Cross List
**Role:** Bullet-style benefits list inside comparison cards

Each item is a 16px weight 500 label preceded by a circular checkmark (#000000 filled, white check) or cross (#000000 with white ×). Items stack at 8px row gap inside the card padding.

### Hand-Drawn Underline Accent
**Role:** Personality flourish under hero or section keywords

Nanum Pen Script at 28–30px in #ff6808, positioned beneath a single key word in the headline. Never used for more than one word per heading, and only on hero/feature sections — not on body copy.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use #4570ff exclusively for primary actions — pill button at 9999px radius, 12px × 24px padding, 16px weight 500 white text
- Reach for #ff6808 (Ember Orange) for the signature personality accents: hero underlines, feature section backgrounds, outlined buttons — never for body text or neutral UI
- Apply 20px radius to all cards, 9999px to all buttons and tags, 40px to hero plates and full-bleed section edges
- Set display headings (64px and above) at -0.05em letter-spacing; tighten progressively to -0.02em at 24px and reach near-zero at 14px body
- Pair the Nanum Pen Script only with hero or section-level headings, and only beneath a single keyword — it is punctuation, not a running style
- Alternate full-bleed black bands with warm bone (#f1f0ec) sections to create the contrast rhythm that makes the pastel and lime accents feel alive
- Use the four pastel card variants (#ebdcff, #d6e0ff, #c293f1, #193f78, #244f47) in rotation across feature grids to add color variety without introducing new tokens

### Don't
- Don't fill buttons with #ff6808 — orange is an accent, not an action; the only filled action color is #4570ff
- Don't apply Nanum Pen Script to body copy, navigation, buttons, or anything below heading level — it loses its personality when overused
- Don't use shadows or heavy elevation to separate cards — the system relies on fill contrast (white on bone, pastel on white, black on photo), not drop shadows
- Don't introduce new saturated colors for UI — the palette is intentionally tight: one indigo, one orange, one lime, and four pastel variants
- Don't set body text below 14px or above 18px — the readable range is narrow and the negative tracking is calibrated for it
- Don't use #c6ff94 (Lime Highlighter) as a background outside of dark or photo sections — on white it reads as low-contrast and washed out
- Don't apply +0.025em opened tracking to anything other than 14px weight 700 eyebrow labels — it is reserved for that specific all-caps label style

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 0 | Page Canvas | `#ffffff` | Primary page background |
| 1 | Warm Bone Section | `#f1f0ec` | Secondary canvas, large content bands, soft section backgrounds |
| 2 | Card Surface | `#ffffff` | Product cards, content cards sitting on the bone background |
| 3 | Dark Band | `#000000` | Full-bleed dark sections, dramatic comparison cards, photo overlays |
| 4 | Pastel Wash | `#d6e0ff / #ebdcff` | Soft tinted card and section variants for visual rhythm |

## Elevation

The system intentionally avoids drop shadows. Elevation is communicated through fill contrast — white cards on warm bone surfaces, pastel cards on white, black cards on photo backgrounds — and through the dramatic black bands that act as full-bleed separators. The absence of shadows is a deliberate choice that keeps the page feeling flat, modern, and graphic, letting the orange and lime accents do the visual lifting instead of shadow stacks.

## Imagery

Imagery is sparse and purposeful. The only full-bleed photograph is a dark, warm-lit restaurant interior (wood tones, ambient glow) used as a single trust/case-study band — it grounds the brand in its restaurant context without dominating. Product screenshots appear inside dark-bordered device frames with the app UI composited over the photo, showing real software rather than illustrations. No illustrations, no 3D renders, no abstract graphics. Icons are minimal: simple filled circles for check/cross marks in comparison lists. The visual weight is overwhelmingly typographic and layout-driven, with color (not imagery) doing the decorative work.

## Layout

Page is centered with a 1200px max-width content well on a pure white canvas. The hero is a centered text block — large 48–64px weight 500 headline, orange Nanum Pen Script underline accent, single indigo pill CTA — with no hero image. The page alternates between four content shapes: (1) centered text + CTA blocks on white, (2) side-by-side comparison cards in a 2-column grid with a light bone card paired against a black card, (3) full-bleed dark photographic bands for social proof, and (4) tabbed feature sections with a colored panel + white text panel split. Feature grids use 3–4 column card layouts with rotating pastel card fills. Section gaps run 64–80px, with 20–24px card padding and 8–12px element gaps. Navigation is a top bar: logo left, 6 nav links center, indigo CTA + bone login pill right. The overall density is compact but with generous breathing room around the dark bands, which act as full-bleed dividers between otherwise quiet content sections.

## Agent Prompt Guide

Quick Color Reference:
- primary action: #4570ff (filled action)
- Accent / personality: #ff6808 (Ember Orange)
- Highlight on dark: #c6ff94 (Lime)
- Text primary: #000000
- Text secondary: #6e6d6c (Smoke)
- Surface base: #ffffff (Paper White)
- Surface secondary: #f1f0ec (Warm Bone)
- Border: #e5e7eb (Hairline)

Example Component Prompts:

1. Create a hero section on white: centered 64px weight 500 headline in #000000 with the word 'actually' (or one key word) underlined in #ff6808 using Nanum Pen Script at 28px. Subhead at 18px weight 400 in #6e6d6c. Single indigo pill CTA at 9999px radius, #4570ff fill, white 16px weight 500 text, 12px × 24px padding. Section vertical padding 80px.

2. Create a before/after comparison: two cards side by side at 20px radius. Left card #f1f0ec fill, 24px padding, 36px weight 500 heading in #000000, three list items with 8px row gap, each prefixed by a filled black circle with a white × mark. Right card identical structure but #000000 fill, white text, and filled black circle with white check mark.

3. Create a feature grid of 4 cards in a row: each card 20px radius, 24px padding, varying pastel fills — #ebdcff, #d6e0ff, #c293f1, #193f78. Heading at 24px weight 500, body at 14px weight 400. Text color switches to white on #193f78 and #244f47, stays #000000 on the lighter pastels.

4. Create a tabbed product feature: white background section, centered 36px weight 500 heading. Tab row below with 5 tab labels in 16px weight 400 #6e6d6c; active tab is 16px weight 500 #000000 with a 2px #4570ff underline. Content below: left half is a #ff6808 orange panel (20px radius, 20px padding) containing a product screenshot frame; right half is a white panel (20px radius, 20px padding) with a 24px weight 500 heading and 14px body text.

5. Create a case study logo band: full-bleed dark restaurant photo background, 40px top radius. Row of 6 restaurant logos in white, evenly spaced. Beneath each logo, a white pill tag (9999px radius, #ffffff fill, 12px weight 400 #000000 text, 4px × 12px padding) reading 'Case study'.
