# Bento — Style Reference
> bento lunchbox on sunlit linoleum. A grid of rounded, sticker-like cards in lime, lavender, cobalt, and maroon, each ringed with thick black ink, sitting on warm off-white linen beneath a confident geometric headline.

**Theme:** mixed

Bento speaks in a sunlit, pop-art bento-box language: full-bleed banded sections in lime, royal blue, and maroon stack vertically like a Japanese lunch tray, separated by generous white space on a warm linen canvas (#f3f3f1). The system is high-contrast and confident — thick black outlines wrap nearly every shape (1284+ black border occurrences), giving cards, buttons, and illustrations a hand-drawn, sticker-like quality that rejects soft shadows. Typography is tight and assertive: a custom geometric sans at up to 800 weight, with negative tracking that pulls display headlines into a single dense mass at 80px. The color palette is deliberately loud but disciplined — lime green is the single loud action accent, while maroon, royal blue, lavender, forest, cobalt, and gold serve as decorative section/card fills. Components lean pill-shaped (99px) and heavily rounded (64px, 32px), with small-radius (8px) exceptions for nav and inputs. The overall mood is playful, maximalist, and unapologetically graphic — a creator-tool brand that celebrates personality over neutrality.

## Tokens — Colors

| Name | Value | Token | Role |
|------|-------|-------|------|
| Lime Spark | `#d2e823` | `--color-lime-spark` | Primary action buttons, active nav fills, highlight card surfaces — the single loud CTA accent that punches through every colored band |
| Lavender Mist | `#e9c0e9` | `--color-lavender-mist` | Decorative borders, icon outlines, soft card edges, and subtle highlight washes — a pastel companion that desaturates without disappearing |
| Cobalt Band | `#2665d6` | `--color-cobalt-band` | Violet outline accent for tags, dividers, and focused UI edges. Do not promote it to the primary CTA color |
| Maroon Plate | `#780016` | `--color-maroon-plate` | Deep section backgrounds, card fills — anchors the lower page with a wine-colored tray that makes white type glow |
| Cobalt Deep | `#061492` | `--color-cobalt-deep` | Card surface fills for product mockups and feature blocks — a denser, more intense blue than Cobalt Band |
| Forest Ink | `#254f1a` | `--color-forest-ink` | Card surface fills, body accent text — the dark green that grounds warm-toned card compositions |
| Mustard Pop | `#d6a337` | `--color-mustard-pop` | Card surface fills, decorative tile colors — a warm gold that adds variety to bento grid compositions |
| Linen Canvas | `#f3f3f1` | `--color-linen-canvas` | Page background, neutral button fills, soft section breaks — the warm off-white base that lets colored bands float |
| White Plate | `#ffffff` | `--color-white-plate` | Card surfaces, form inputs, icon fills, and inverted text on dark/colored backgrounds |
| Ink Black | `#000000` | `--color-ink-black` | Primary text, dominant borders (all cards/buttons/icons carry a black stroke), and illustration outlines — the structural ink that defines every shape |
| Midnight Ink | `#1e2330` | `--color-midnight-ink` | Secondary dark text and borders, heading strokes on light surfaces, icon outlines — a near-black with a cool cast that softens the harshness of pure black |
| Sage Mute | `#676b5f` | `--color-sage-mute` | Muted helper text, secondary link borders, low-emphasis captions — a desaturated olive-gray that recedes without disappearing |
| Silver Border | `#c7c8cb` | `--color-silver-border` | Subtle button borders, disabled states, low-emphasis dividers |
| Charcoal Pill | `#222222` | `--color-charcoal-pill` | Dark mode button borders, hover state outlines on inverted components |
| Concrete Tile | `#adadad` | `--color-concrete-tile` | Placeholder card backgrounds, skeleton states, and muted tile fills |
| Leaf Wash | `#ebffc5` | `--color-leaf-wash` | Soft section backgrounds and highlight washes — a very pale lime that echoes Lime Spark without competing |
| Moss Tint | `#e8efd6` | `--color-moss-tint` | Alternate pale surface for section banding — a desaturated green-gray that adds another neutral layer |

## Components

### Lime Spark Primary Button
**Role:** Single dominant CTA — sign up, get started, submit

Fill #d2e823, text #000000 at Linksans 700 16px, 99px pill radius, padding 18px 28px or 20px horizontal. Carries a 2-3px solid #000000 border that makes the lime read as a sticker rather than a flat button. Hover deepens the lime slightly; active adds a small downward translate. No drop shadow — the black outline IS the elevation.

### Ghost Pill Button
**Role:** Secondary action — Log in, Cancel, Learn more

Transparent fill, text #000000 at Linksans 500 16px, 99px pill radius, padding 18px 22px. 2px #000000 border. Sits beside primary without competing.

### White Inverted Button
**Role:** CTA on colored band sections (maroon, blue, lime)

Fill #ffffff, text #000000, 99px radius, Linksans 700 16px, 18px 28px padding. Always wrapped in a thin #000000 border to maintain the sticker aesthetic on any background.

### Social Link Pill
**Role:** Creator profile link button (the bento.me link-in-bio use case)

Fill #ffffff or #f3f3f1, text #000000 Linksans 500 14-16px, 99px pill, 2px #000000 border, 14-18px vertical padding, 20-24px horizontal padding. Icon left at 20px, always monoline black.

### Bento Card Surface
**Role:** Feature card, product block, or decorative tile in a bento grid

One of the brand fills (Lime Spark, Lavender Mist, Cobalt Deep, Forest Ink, Mustard Pop, Maroon Plate, or Linen Canvas). Radius 32-64px, 2-3px #000000 border, padding 20-24px. No shadow. Text color inverts to #ffffff or #000000 based on the card's fill luminance.

### Organic Blob Card
**Role:** Hero illustration card, decorative shape, phone mockup frame

Uses the 1000px radius (effectively a squircle/blob). Fill is a brand color or white, always ringed by 2-3px #000000 border. The signature shape: looks like a sticker peeled from a sheet.

### Phone Mockup Frame
**Role:** Product preview — showcases the creator's link page on a phone

Black-bordered rounded rectangle, 32-64px radius, displaying a screenshot of a bento.me page inside. Often tilted 2-4° for dynamism. The frame itself is #000000 or a brand color fill.

### Section Band Background
**Role:** Full-bleed colored section — hero, feature, CTA zones

Full viewport width, min-height 80vh. Fills rotate through Lime Spark, Cobalt Band, Maroon Plate, and Linen Canvas to create the bento-tray effect. Section padding 64-80px vertical. Headlines on dark bands use #ffffff or #d2e823; on light bands use #000000.

### Pill Navigation Bar
**Role:** Top-level site navigation

Float centered, white (#ffffff) fill, 8px radius, 2px #000000 border, padding 8px 8px 8px 24px. Logo left, nav links center as ghost text, CTA right as Lime Spark pill or dark button.

### Form Input
**Role:** Text input for email, name, search

Fill #ffffff, 2px #000000 border, 8px radius, padding 12px 16px. Placeholder text in #757575 at Linksans 400 16px. Focus state thickens border to 3px and adds a Lime Spark outer ring at 2px offset.

### Cookie Consent Modal
**Role:** Privacy/cookie notice overlay

Fixed bottom-left card, fill #ffffff, 16-32px radius, 2-3px #000000 border, padding 24px, max-width 360px. Title Linksans 700 16px #000000, body Linksans 400 14px #676b5f. Three stacked buttons: Accept All (Lime Spark filled), Reject All (ghost), Customize (ghost text link).

### Monoline Icon
**Role:** UI icons — nav, social, features

1.5-2px stroke, #000000 fill or stroke, no color fills. Square or circular bounding box, 20-24px display size. Style is flat geometric, no shadows or gradients.

### Top Banner Strip
**Role:** Promotional announcement bar (e.g. 'THE CREATOR INDEX')

Full-bleed, 40-48px height, Leaf Wash (#ebffc5) or Lime Spark fill, text Linksans 500 14px #000000, centered. Underline accent on key phrase.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use Lime Spark (#d2e823) as the single primary action fill — never introduce a second CTA color, the loudness of lime only works in isolation
- Wrap every card, button, and illustration in a 2-3px solid #000000 border — the black outline is the elevation system, drop shadows are forbidden
- Use 99px pill radius for every interactive element (buttons, tags, social links) and 32-64px for card surfaces
- Stack sections as full-bleed color bands rotating through Lime Spark, Cobalt Band (#2665d6), Maroon Plate (#780016), and Linen Canvas (#f3f3f1)
- Set display headlines at 80px Linksans 800 with -0.043em tracking so they read as a single shape, not a sentence
- Invert card text to #ffffff or #000000 based on the fill luminance — never use a mid-gray for card text
- Use the 1000px radius (squircle/blob) for hero illustrations, phone mockups, and organic decorative shapes

### Don't
- Don't add drop shadows, inner shadows, or blur effects — the black border IS the elevation; stacking shadows breaks the sticker aesthetic
- Don't use Lavender Mist (#e9c0e9), Forest Ink (#254f1a), or Mustard Pop (#d6a337) as CTA fills — they are decorative card colors, not action colors
- Don't introduce a neutral gray button that competes with Lime Spark — secondary actions must be ghost/outlined with a black border
- Don't use Cobalt Band (#2665d6) or Maroon Plate (#780016) for body text — they are section background fills, not legible text colors
- Don't soften the type with positive letter-spacing or light weights in headlines — the design only works when display type is 700-800 and tightly tracked
- Don't use sharp corners (< 8px) on any card or button — the system requires organic rounding at every level
- Don't use #000000 text on the Maroon Plate or Cobalt Band backgrounds without first testing contrast — use #ffffff or #d2e823 instead

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 0 | Linen Canvas | `#f3f3f1` | Page base, default section background between color bands |
| 1 | White Plate | `#ffffff` | Card surfaces, form inputs, modals, navigation float |
| 2 | Leaf Wash | `#ebffc5` | Soft highlight sections, banner strips, subtle elevated wash |
| 3 | Moss Tint | `#e8efd6` | Alternate neutral surface, section banding variation |
| 4 | Concrete Tile | `#adadad` | Skeleton/placeholder card fills, muted tile backgrounds |
| 5 | Cobalt Band | `#2665d6` | Full-bleed section background — hero/feature band |
| 6 | Maroon Plate | `#780016` | Full-bleed section background — bottom CTA/social band |

## Elevation

Bento has no drop shadows. The entire elevation system is replaced by a consistent 2-3px solid #000000 border on every elevated element — cards, buttons, modals, illustrations, and phone mockups. This creates a flat, sticker-like, comic-book aesthetic where shape is defined by outline rather than by light. A hover state may add a 2px translate, but never a shadow.

## Imagery

The site is image-led, using three distinct visual modes: (1) 3D-rendered phone mockups tilted 2-4° displaying the bento product UI, always framed by thick black borders to match the sticker aesthetic; (2) colorful bento-grid card compositions — small rounded squares in brand colors (maroon, cobalt, lime, mustard, lavender) arranged in a masonry-like cluster, each ringed in black; (3) lifestyle photography in the hero band — staged portraits of creators in saturated color environments (a man in a brown suit against maroon wood paneling, a person in a red beanie against a blue background). Illustrations are flat with heavy black outlines, no gradients, no soft shadows. The overall density is balanced — roughly 40% imagery, 60% text/colored surface, with the color bands doing as much visual work as the photos.

## Layout

Full-bleed vertically stacked color bands with no central max-width on the sections themselves — each band stretches edge-to-edge. Content within bands is centered with a max-width of ~1200px, using a 12-column grid. The hero is a left-aligned headline + right-aligned phone mockup split (50/50). Subsequent sections alternate: text-left/image-right, then text-right/image-left, creating a Z-pattern rhythm. The bento grid sections use a 2x3 or 3x3 asymmetric masonry of rounded color tiles. The bottom band is a maroon full-bleed with a left-aligned headline and a right-side bento card cluster. Vertical rhythm is generous — 64-80px between sections, with the color band transitions themselves acting as the dividers. Navigation is a floating white pill bar centered at the top, not a full-width header.
