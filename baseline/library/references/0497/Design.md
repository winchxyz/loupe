# Canva — Style Reference
> candy-colored creative studio — a white canvas floating inside a gradient sky

**Theme:** light

Canva's design system is a candy-colored creative studio: a canvas that breathes, floats, and splashes through saturated gradient skies. The interface alternates between pure white workspace moments and full-bleed chromatic panels that serve as the real product showcase — teal-to-violet, magenta-to-coral, emerald-to-lime — each one a mood rather than a decorative fill. Typography is a custom humanist sans (Canva Sans) that stays warm and friendly at every weight; display sizes stretch to 80px with whisper-tight tracking, while body text sits at 16–18px in a comfortable 1.4–1.5 line height. Surfaces are flat with subtle 8px rounding and barely-there blue-tinted shadows; elevation is implied through color and gradient rather than depth. The wordmark is a hand-cut italic script, the only curved-letterform in the system, acting as a signature stamp on the otherwise geometric UI.

White fill, Ink Black text, 8px radius, 8–12px padding, 14px weight 500. Sits in the top-left or bottom-left of a gradient feature card.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use full-bleed gradient panels as the chromatic stage for product features — let teal-to-violet, coral-sunset, emerald-meadow, and ultraviolet-horizon carry the visual weight, not small icon accents.
- Set all body text in Canva Sans weight 400 at 16–18px with line-height 1.5–1.57; Canva's tone is conversational, not compressed.
- Anchor every primary action with a solid white or solid Ink Black button at 8px radius, 12px/20px padding, weight 500 — never use a chromatic fill for the main CTA when it competes with gradient panels.
- Apply 8px radius as the default for all cards, buttons, and chips; reserve 16px for full-bleed gradient feature panels and 9999px for pills and search fields.
- Maintain a single -0.0100em letter-spacing across the Canva Sans scale; let the typeface's humanist warmth do the work without aggressive tracking tweaks.
- Build section rhythm as white-space → gradient-panel → white-space, with 64px section gaps; the alternation is the page's signature.
- Pair the Canva Sans geometric forms with the custom italic script wordmark for logo lockups; the script's curves are the only deviation from the system's straight geometry.

### Don't
- Don't use chromatic fills for the main CTA button — white or Ink Black only, so it never fights the gradient panels.
- Don't apply heavy drop shadows; Canva's elevation is whisper-light, with blue-tinted stacks at rgba(24,44,89,0.07–0.14) and 0.5px hairline borders.
- Don't use Canva Sans at weight 700 or above; the system maxes out at 600, and most display headlines sit at weight 400 for warmth.
- Don't introduce new chromatic accent hues — stick to the brand palette: Canva Violet, Deep Amethyst, Ember Red, Plasma Pink, Solar Orange.
- Don't compress line-height below 1.25 even for display sizes; the humanist proportions need air.
- Don't use sharp 0px radius on rectangular elements; the system is consistently rounded, and 8px is the floor.
- Don't replace Canva Sans with Times or Arial — those are fallback scaffolding for image-rendered text inside template thumbnails, not page UI.

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 0 | Paper White | `#ffffff` | Base page canvas, negative space, breathing room between gradient sections |
| 1 | White Card | `#ffffff` | Feature card surfaces on white page, category pill backgrounds |
| 2 | Gradient Panel | `#7d2ae8` | Full-bleed feature card backgrounds, hero zone — the chromatic stage where the product lives |

## Elevation

- **Feature card / product tile:** `rgba(64, 79, 109, 0.06) 0px 0px 0px 0.5px, rgba(24, 44, 89, 0.137) 0px 2px 4px 0px, rgba(24, 44, 89, 0.07) 0px 6px 12px 0px`
- **Primary button (light variant):** `rgba(53, 65, 90, 0.2) 0px 0px 0px 1px inset`
- **Primary button (dark variant):** `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2) 0px 0px 0px 1px inset`

## Imagery

Imagery lives in two modes. The first is product-showcase photography and user-generated content embedded inside gradient feature cards — lifestyle shots of people using printed products, template previews showing Disney characters, app integration logos rendered as colorful tiles. The second is 3D-rendered design tool icons: small glass-morphism cubes containing typographic letters (T for text, C for circle, </> for code), emoji-style sticker icons (heart, sparkle, smile), and colored gradient orbs. These float in a scattered constellation in the hero and serve as the visual proxy for 'every creative tool you can imagine.' Photography is high-key, warm, and staged rather than candid; product crops are tight with no lifestyle context. Icon style is rounded, colorful, and 3D-shaded — they read as playful physical objects rather than flat UI glyphs.

## Layout

Page model is centered with a max-width of 1280px for content blocks, but full-bleed gradient sections break out of the container to span the entire viewport. The hero is a full-bleed gradient with a centered headline over a teal-to-violet wash, followed by a floating icon constellation. Below the hero, sections alternate between white-space and full-bleed gradient feature cards in a 2-column asymmetric grid — one large card on the left, a smaller stacked pair on the right, or balanced equal halves. Content arrangement uses centered headline stacks followed by horizontal card carousels, not alternating text-left/image-right. The category navigation strip is a horizontal scrolling pill bar that sits above the feature card grid. Section gaps are generous (64px), creating a spacious, gallery-like rhythm rather than a dense information layout. Navigation is a thin transparent top bar that becomes white on scroll, with centered pill links and right-aligned action buttons.

## Gradient System

Gradients are the real product palette. Six named gradients form a spectrum from cool to warm to natural:
- **Teal Violet Sky** (135deg, teal → violet) — the default hero and product feature card
- **Coral Sunset** (vertical, red → orange → peach) — lifestyle, print, commerce cards
- **Emerald Meadow** (vertical, deep green → lime → cream) — app integrations, growth cards
- **Ulraviolet Horizon** (98deg, deep purple → indigo → cyan → white) — the most expansive hero, reserved for peak brand moments
- **Plasma Wash** (vertical, violet → magenta → pink) — creative expression, AI/Magic Studio surfaces
- **Cyan Violet** (135deg, teal → indigo → violet) — secondary product feature variants

All gradients sweep diagonally or vertically; none are radial. Each terminates in a lighter tone to create a sense of atmospheric depth, not flat color blocks.

## Typography Attitude

Canva Sans is humanist and warm — its open apertures and slightly rounded terminals make it feel approachable, not corporate. The system makes one non-obvious choice: display headlines use weight 400, not 600–700. This puts visual mass in the letterforms and the tracking (-0.0100em) rather than the weight, keeping the tone conversational even at 64–80px. The ss02 and ss03 stylistic alternates should be on by default to add personality to the otherwise geometric character set.

## Similar Brands

- **Figma** — Same approach of using a single dominant brand accent (Figma orange, Canva violet) against a white canvas with full-bleed gradient feature panels and flat rounded cards
- **Notion** — Similar comfortable density, custom humanist sans typeface, flat surfaces with hairline borders and barely-there shadows, and the same commitment to a single whisper-tone for body text
- **Spline** — Shared use of saturated multi-color gradients as page backgrounds and feature card fills, with white text overlaid — both treat color as the canvas, not the decoration
- **Stripe** — Similar whisper-tight letter-spacing at display sizes (-0.0100em territory), gradient feature sections, and the pattern of alternating white workspace with chromatic content blocks
- **Linear** — Same ultra-clean flat-surface language with 8px default radius, thin blue-tinted shadows, and pill-shaped navigation elements
