# Tally Forms — Style Reference
> Notebook doodles on warm paper — a gray-paper canvas scattered with magenta-pink hand-drawn marks and centered editorial headlines.

**Theme:** light

Tally's visual system reads as 'notebook doodles on warm paper' — a quiet, editorial interface where a warm gray canvas (#e0e0df) carries white card surfaces and almost everything else steps out of the way so that one vivid magenta-pink (#f81ce5) can do the emotional work. That pink is reserved for illustration strokes, icon outlines, and the occasional decorative border on a feature card — it never fills a button. Conversion is handled by a single classic blue (#0070d7), keeping brand expression and action expression separate. Typography is Inter in a wide weight range, tracked tight at -0.031em, with a 64px display headline that feels closer to a magazine masthead than a SaaS hero. Hand-drawn squiggles, underlines, and star/confetti motifs float around the margins, turning the page edges into a sketchbook rather than leaving them as dead space. Cards are flat white on warm gray with a subtle warm-tinted shadow stack, rounded at 10px, and the overall rhythm is comfortable — generous gaps, centered hero, then 2-up feature columns.

## Tokens — Colors

| Name | Value | Token | Role |
|------|-------|-------|------|
| Tally Magenta | `radial-gradient(circle, rgba(248,28,229,0.36) 0%, rgba(248,28,229,0) 70%)` | `--color-tally-magenta` | Pink decorative accent for icons, marks, and small graphic details. Do not promote it to the primary CTA color; Decorative focus-ring and glow tint used to draw the eye to a highlighted feature card, applied as a soft 2–4px outer ring rather than a fill |
| Action Blue | `#0070d7` | `--color-action-blue` | Primary action buttons only — the lone chromatic fill in the system, used to mark conversion moments without competing with the magenta brand mark |
| Ink | `#37352f` | `--color-ink` | Primary text, heading fills, and the dominant dark border color across cards, body elements, and form chrome. A warm near-black rather than pure black |
| Paper | `#e0e0df` | `--color-paper` | Page canvas — the warm light-gray background that all white card surfaces sit on. The signature surface of the system |
| White | `#ffffff` | `--color-white` | Card surfaces, form previews, input fields, and icon fills on the canvas. Provides the only bright surface layer |
| Mist | `#f3f3f3` | `--color-mist` | Subtle elevated or muted surface for secondary panels, code blocks, and hover washes — a half-step darker than pure white |
| Graphite | `#898884` | `--color-graphite` | Secondary text, helper copy, and tertiary borders on icons and body elements |
| Ash | `#777672` | `--color-ash` | Muted borders, inactive dividers, and low-emphasis strokes for icons and form elements |
| Charcoal | `#45433e` | `--color-charcoal` | Dark borders and separators for elevated surfaces and inverted UI. Do not promote it to the primary CTA color |
| Black | `#000000` | `--color-black` | Heading borders, the dark header CTA button fill, and the highest-contrast button text — reserved for moments that need maximum weight |
| Purple-to-Pink | `linear-gradient(to right, rgb(138,70,255) 0%, rgb(248,28,224) 50%)` | `--color-purple-to-pink` | Underline and streak flourishes under display headlines — a short linear sweep from violet to magenta that replaces the traditional squiggle |

## Components

### Primary CTA Button
**Role:** The sole conversion button in the system, used for the hero and major signup moments.

Blue (#0070d7) filled, white text, Inter 15px weight 500, 7px radius, 6px vertical and 14px horizontal padding. No border. Often paired with a right-pointing arrow glyph in white.

### Dark Header Button
**Role:** The persistent 'Create form' action in the top-right navigation.

Black (#000000) filled, white text, Inter 15px weight 500, 7px radius, 6px vertical and 14px horizontal padding. Reads as a secondary action to the blue CTA but stays high-contrast against the Paper canvas.

### Submit Button (in-app)
**Role:** The dark form-submission control rendered inside the form preview.

Black (#000000) filled, white text, small size, 7px radius, paired with a white arrow glyph.

### Form Preview Card
**Role:** The hero visual — a chrome-windowed card showing a live form being edited.

White (#ffffff) surface, 10px radius, with the four-stack warm shadow: 1px hairline + 1px border + 3px/9px blur + 2px/5px blur. Includes macOS-style window dots and an inline editable title in Inter 30px weight 700.

### Standard Feature Card
**Role:** Two-column feature explanations in the lower page sections.

White surface, 10px radius, soft single-layer shadow (rgba(0,0,0,0.09) 0px 3px 12px 0px), 24px internal padding. Magenta-pink icon glyph (1.5px stroke) sits at the top-left in #f81ce5. Heading 22px weight 700 in Ink, body 16px weight 400 in Graphite.

### Highlighted Feature Card
**Role:** The occasional card that carries a pink accent border to draw the eye (e.g. 'Unlimited forms and submissions for free').

White surface, 10px radius, wrapped in a 2px solid #f81ce5 outer ring + 4px rgba(248,28,229,0.36) glow. Heading rendered in Magenta (#f81ce5) rather than Ink to reinforce the accent.

### Inline Text Link
**Role:** Mid-paragraph links inside body copy and footer text.

Charcoal (#45433e) text with a 1.5–2px underline in the same color. No box, no background — pure inline text. Often wraps a phrase like 'fair usage guidelines' or 'no-code conference'.

### Text Input Field
**Role:** The single-line input used inside form previews (e.g. 'Free placeholder text').

White fill, 1px Ash (#777672) border, 7px radius, 8–10px vertical padding, placeholder text in Graphite (#898884). No focus ring color observed in the hero, suggesting a subtle 1px border darkening on focus rather than a glow.

### Logo Bar Item
**Role:** Partner/customer logos arranged in a single row to signal social proof.

Logos rendered in Ink (#37352f) monochrome at 20–24px height, evenly spaced with 24–32px gaps. No cards, no borders — logos float directly on the Paper canvas.

### Product Hunt Badge
**Role:** The '2023 Product Hunt Golden Kitty Winner' award pill.

Black (#000000) filled, 7px radius, white text 13px weight 500, a small trophy icon at 14px in Magenta (#f81ce5) or yellow. Vertically centered in its own row.

### Doodle Illustration
**Role:** The hand-drawn squiggles, speech bubbles, stars, faces, and arrows scattered around page margins.

1.5–2px stroke in Ink (#37352f) for faces, speech bubbles, and arrows. 1.5px stroke in Magenta (#f81ce5) for confetti, stars, sparkles, and accent marks. Never filled, never colored — line art only. Some underline flourishes use the Purple-to-Pink linear gradient sweep.

### Underline Flourish
**Role:** A short hand-drawn underline that sits beneath a keyword in the display headline (e.g. under 'simplest').

Either a 2px Magenta squiggle stroke or a Purple-to-Pink linear-gradient sweep clipped to an underline shape, 40–60% the width of the underlined word, with a slight horizontal offset.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use #0070d7 exclusively for primary action buttons — never repurpose the magenta or any other chromatic color for fills.
- Reserve #f81ce5 for line art, icon strokes, decorative card borders, and the occasional highlight-ring; it should never be a button fill or large background block.
- Set all headings in Inter weight 700–800 with letter-spacing -0.031em — the tight tracking is what makes the 64px display feel editorial rather than corporate.
- Pair a white 10px-radius card with the four-stack warm shadow when the card needs to feel like a product surface; use the single-layer 3px/12px shadow for simpler feature cards.
- Float hand-drawn doodles and underline flourishes in the page margins using 1.5–2px strokes in Ink and Magenta only — they should feel loose and off-center, not grid-aligned.
- Keep the page canvas at #e0e0df and let white cards do the lifting — avoid introducing additional gray surface levels beyond the Mist (#f3f3f3) tier.
- Use 7px radius for all buttons, inputs, and tags, and 10px radius for all cards — these two values define the system's corner language.

### Don't
- Do not use #f81ce5 as a button background, link color, or text color at body sizes — it is a decorative and illustrative color, not an interface fill.
- Do not introduce new chromatic accents (greens, oranges, purples) — the system is intentionally two-color (blue for action, magenta for expression) plus a warm neutral scale.
- Do not use pure black (#000000) for body text — Ink (#37352f) is the text color; reserve black for heading borders and the dark header button.
- Do not apply large heavy shadows or colored glows to standard cards — the warm 1px border + soft blur stack is the only elevation language.
- Do not center-align body copy in the lower feature sections — the cards and paragraphs should left-align to preserve the editorial reading rhythm.
- Do not stretch the doodle illustrations into full-bleed banners or hero backgrounds — they are margin ornaments, not primary imagery.
- Do not round cards to 16px or larger, and do not round buttons to pill (9999px) shapes — 10px and 7px are the system's radii vocabulary.

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 0 | Paper | `#e0e0df` | Page canvas — the warm gray background behind every section |
| 1 | White | `#ffffff` | Card and form-preview surfaces that sit on the paper canvas |
| 2 | Mist | `#f3f3f3` | Secondary elevated surfaces, code snippets, and quiet hover states |

## Elevation

- **Form preview card:** `rgba(0,0,0,0.12) 0px 1px 1px 0px, rgba(61,59,53,0.16) 0px 0px 0px 1px, rgba(61,59,53,0.08) 0px 3px 9px 0px, rgba(61,59,53,0.08) 0px 2px 5px 0px`
- **Standard feature card:** `rgba(0,0,0,0.09) 0px 3px 12px 0px`
- **Highlighted feature card:** `0px 0px 0px 2px #f81ce5, 0px 0px 0px 4px rgba(248,28,229,0.36)`

## Imagery

The visual language is illustration-led, not photography-led. The dominant graphics are hand-drawn line-art doodles — faces, speech bubbles, squiggles, stars, confetti, sparkles, and arrows — rendered at 1.5–2px stroke in Ink (#37352f) for the main outlines and Magenta (#f81ce5) for accent marks. Doodles float freely in the page margins around the hero and feature sections, never cropped or masked, giving the impression of a hand-sketched notebook. The only product imagery is a single in-browser form preview rendered as a chrome-windowed white card. There is no lifestyle photography, no 3D, no abstract gradients used as backgrounds. Icon style is consistent with the doodles — outlined, 1.5px stroke, mono, brand-colored in Magenta on feature cards. Imagery is decorative atmosphere first, explanatory content never — the real information is carried by typography and white card surfaces.

## Layout

The page is centered and max-width contained at ~1200px, with a full-bleed Paper (#e0e0df) canvas behind everything. The hero is a centered stack: a 64px display headline, a 2-line subhead at 18px, a single blue CTA, a micro-helper line, then a wide white form-preview card directly beneath. Below the hero the page drops into a centered logo bar, a Product Hunt badge row, and then a left-aligned 2-column feature section. Further down, a 2-up grid of feature cards (highlighted card on the left with a pink border, standard card on the right) appears, followed by another 2-up row of standard cards. Vertical rhythm is comfortable: roughly 64px between major sections, 24px between a card heading and its body, 8px between a body line and its supporting meta. Navigation is a minimal top bar — wordmark left, text links and a dark button right — with no sticky behavior, no mega-menu, and no sidebar.

## Agent Prompt Guide

## Quick Color Reference
- Text: #37352f (Ink)
- Background (page): #e0e0df (Paper)
- Background (card): #ffffff (White)
- Border (default): #777672 (Ash) / #37352f (Ink) for emphasized
- Accent (decorative/illustrative): #f81ce5 (Tally Magenta)
- primary action: #0070d7 (filled action)

## Example Component Prompts
1. **Hero with display headline** — Centered stack on #e0e0df canvas. Headline at 64px Inter weight 800 in #37352f, letter-spacing -1.98px, with a 2px #f81ce5 hand-drawn squiggle under one keyword. Subhead at 18px Inter weight 400 in #777672. Blue primary button (#0070d7 fill, white text, 7px radius, 6px 14px padding) with a right arrow glyph. Beneath: a white 10px-radius form-preview card with the four-stack warm shadow.

2. **Standard feature card** — White surface, 10px radius, 24px padding, single-layer shadow rgba(0,0,0,0.09) 0px 3px 12px 0px. Magenta #f81ce5 outlined icon (1.5px stroke) at the top-left. Heading 22px Inter weight 700 in #37352f. Body 16px Inter weight 400 in #777672. Optional inline links in #45433e with a 1.5px underline.

3. **Highlighted feature card** — Same base as a standard card but wrapped in a 2px #f81ce5 outer ring plus a 4px rgba(248,28,229,0.36) glow. Heading rendered in #f81ce5 instead of Ink. Reserved for the one card per row that needs to pull the eye.

4. **Logo bar row** — Centered single row on the Paper canvas, no card, no border. Five monochrome logos in #37352f at 20–24px height, evenly spaced with 24–32px gaps. Optional 'Powering 500,000+ teams' label at 13px Inter weight 500 in #777672 sits above the row.

5. **Dark header button** — Black #000000 fill, white text, 15px Inter weight 500, 7px radius, 6px 14px padding. Sits in the top-right of the nav bar next to ghost text links in #37352f.

## Two-Color Discipline

The system enforces a strict separation between brand expression and conversion: Magenta (#f81ce5) is the voice — it appears in illustrations, icon strokes, decorative borders, and the occasional highlight ring; Blue (#0070d7) is the action — it appears only on filled primary buttons. No screen should ever use Magenta as a button fill, link color, or large background. No screen should ever use Blue decoratively. This split is the core of the visual identity: the page feels playful and human because Magenta is free to be expressive, while conversion moments stay calm and unmistakably clickable because Blue is reserved and rare.

## Similar Brands

- **Linear** — Same tight Inter tracking at display sizes, clean white-card-on-gray hierarchy, and a single chromatic accent reserved for brand expression rather than buttons.
- **Coda** — Same form-builder-adjacent product category with a minimal chromatic palette, flat white feature cards, and a clear separation between brand color and action color.
- **Pitch** — Same magazine-masthead headline treatment with 60px+ Inter display type, centered hero rhythm, and doodle-style accent marks in the margins.
