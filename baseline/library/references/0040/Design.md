# Cap — Style Reference
> quiet white studio with a single blue spark

**Theme:** light

Cap reads as a calm, white-canvas workspace with a single confident blue accent — the visual language of a focused native desktop tool that happens to live in a browser. Surfaces are nearly white with hairline gray borders doing most of the structural work; elevation is barely-there, leaning on 1px strokes and subtle inset highlights rather than heavy drop shadows. Typography is a single geometric sans at three weights, set generously tight on display sizes, with uppercase eyebrow labels floating at 20% letter-spacing above section headings. The two-color button system — black for download/ownership, blue for upgrade/purchase — carries all the decision-making in the layout; everything else stays quiet. Multi-color gradients appear only inside the product mockup (the wave/ribbon artwork) and never bleed into UI chrome, keeping the interface disciplined.

## Tokens — Colors

| Name | Value | Token | Role |
|------|-------|-------|------|
| Signal Blue | `#3b82f6` | `--color-signal-blue` | Primary brand accent — links, active nav indicators, icon highlights, the inner play-button of the product mockup. Saturated enough to be the one color users remember, restrained enough to never compete with copy |
| Action Blue | `#2563eb` | `--color-action-blue` | Filled CTA buttons (Upgrade to Cap Pro), focus rings, and the strongest interactive state. One shade deeper than Signal Blue to give pressed actions a subtle weight shift |
| Ink Black | `#202020` | `--color-ink-black` | Headings, body text, the dark CTA button fill (Download for free). Off-black rather than pure #000 to avoid harsh edges on white |
| Carbon | `#000000` | `--color-carbon` | Pure black reserved for the highest-emphasis text and icon fills where maximum contrast is required |
| Paper | `#fcfcfc` | `--color-paper` | Page and card canvas — the dominant surface across the entire site. Near-white, not pure white, to soften the reading field |
| Mist | `#f0f0f0` | `--color-mist` | Secondary surface for subtle differentiation — the segmented control track, inset highlights, and muted button backgrounds |
| Fog | `#e0e0e0` | `--color-fog` | Hairline borders on cards, buttons, and the nav bar. The structural divider of the design system |
| Ash | `#e5e7eb` | `--color-ash` | Borders and dividers at the lowest visual layer; also appears as a subtle backdrop wash behind the footer card |
| Steel | `#c2c2c2` | `--color-steel` | Mid-gray for secondary icon strokes and placeholder-like elements that should recede but remain visible |
| Graphite | `#838383` | `--color-graphite` | Muted captions, helper text, and de-emphasized UI labels. |
| Slate | `#646464` | `--color-slate` | Button text on light surfaces, tertiary metadata text. One step deeper than Graphite for buttons that need a touch more presence |
| Outlined Indigo | `#1e40af` | `--color-outlined-indigo` | Violet accent for outlined action borders, linked labels, and lightweight interactive emphasis. |
| Spark Violet | `#7c3aed` | `--color-spark-violet` | Violet text accent for links, tags, and emphasized short phrases |
| Spark Violet Soft | `#8b5cf6` | `--color-spark-violet-soft` | Lighter violet companion to Spark Violet for secondary decorative strokes and gradient endpoints |
| Ember | `#d97706` | `--color-ember` | Orange text accent for links, tags, and emphasized short phrases. |
| Sky | `#0d74ce` | `--color-sky` | Icon stroke variant within the mode selector — the paired companion to Ember for the three-mode icon set |
| Ice | `#e0ecfc` | `--color-ice` | Tinted blue surface wash — a barely-perceptible cool tint used for soft highlight backgrounds and the outer glow ring on the product mockup play button |
| Cyan Glow | `#0090ff` | `--color-cyan-glow` | Bright cyan accent for the glow/shadow halo behind the play button overlay in the product mockup |
| Alert Red | `#ef4444` | `--color-alert-red` | Red wash for highlight backgrounds, decorative bands, and soft emphasis behind content. Use as a supporting accent, not as a status color |
| macOS Red | `#ff5f57` | `--color-macos-red` | Red wash for highlight backgrounds, decorative bands, and soft emphasis behind content. Use as a supporting accent, not as a status color |
| macOS Yellow | `#ffbd2e` | `--color-macos-yellow` | Yellow wash for highlight backgrounds, decorative bands, and soft emphasis behind content. Use as a supporting accent, not as a status color |
| macOS Green | `#28c840` | `--color-macos-green` | Green wash for highlight backgrounds, decorative bands, and soft emphasis behind content. Use as a supporting accent, not as a status color |

## Components

### Floating Nav Bar
**Role:** Top-level navigation, centered and floating

Pill-shaped (9999px radius), white (#fcfcfc) background, 1px #e5e7eb border, 1.5px inset white highlight at the top edge (rgba(255,255,255,0.2)). Contains the logo, nav links, GitHub star count, Login (ghost), and Sign Up (black filled pill). Height ~48px, horizontal padding ~20px. Stays at the top of the viewport with generous margin from the viewport edge.

### Primary CTA Button (Blue)
**Role:** Filled call-to-action for upgrade / purchase

9999px pill radius. Background #2563eb, text #fcfcfc (white), 14–16px, weight 500. Horizontal padding 20px, vertical padding 10px. Subtle 0px 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.05) drop shadow. The 'Upgrade to Cap Pro' button is the canonical example.

### Secondary CTA Button (Black)
**Role:** Filled call-to-action for download / ownership

9999px pill radius. Background #202020 (near-black), text #fcfcfc, weight 500. Same dimensions as the blue CTA. The 'Download for free' button is the canonical example — paired with the blue CTA to form the two-button decision cluster.

### Ghost Button
**Role:** Low-emphasis navigation action (Login)

9999px pill radius, transparent background, 1px #e0e0e0 border, text #202020. Used for secondary actions that should not compete with the primary CTAs.

### Outlined Action Link
**Role:** Tertiary action ('or Switch from Loom')

No background, underlined text link or small ghost button with #1e40af accent border. Sits centered below the CTA pair as a de-prioritized alternative path.

### Segmented Control (Mode Selector)
**Role:** Switching between Instant, Studio, and Screenshot modes

Rounded container with #f0f0f0 background, ~9999px pill radius. Three equally-sized segments. The active segment has a white (#fcfcfc) background with a 1px #e0e0e0 border and a subtle shadow lift. Icons inside are filled/outlined: lightning bolt (Instant), clapperboard (Studio), image (Screenshot). Active icon is larger and bolder; inactive icons are smaller and gray (#838383).

### Eyebrow Badge
**Role:** Uppercase section label above feature titles

11–12px, weight 500, text in #d97706 (Ember) or #202020, letter-spacing 0.2em (20%), uppercase. Optionally preceded by a small 16px filled icon. Examples: 'INSTANT MODE' with a lightning-bolt icon, '3 MODES' in the section header.

### Feature Card
**Role:** Container for feature highlights within a section

White (#fcfcfc) background, 1px #e0e0e0 border, 12px radius, 24px padding. No drop shadow by default; optional 0px 20px 25px -5px rgba(0,0,0,0.05) lift for elevated variants. Content is image-on-top, text-below with 12px gap.

### Download CTA Card
**Role:** Final pre-footer conversion block

White (#fcfcfc) surface, 16px radius, 1px #e0e0e0 border, generous internal padding (~48px vertical). Contains a centered heading, the two-button CTA pair, and a tertiary text link below. Sits inside a subtle #e5e7eb page background to create a contained card feel.

### Product Mockup Container
**Role:** Large hero visual showing the Cap app

Full app window mockup with macOS traffic-light buttons (#ff5f57, #ffbd2, #28c840), title bar, and the recording canvas. A 64px circular blue (#3b82f6) play button with a white triangle sits centered, ringed by a soft #e0ecfc glow and a #0090ff shadow halo. The recording timeline below uses a blue progress fill.

### Trust Logo Strip
**Role:** Social proof line below the hero CTAs

Horizontal row of partner/user logos at 32–40px height, rendered in monochrome gray (#838383 or #c2c2c2). Preceded by a small caption: 'Trusted by 30,000+ teams, builders and creators'. Logos are evenly spaced with 24–32px gaps, left-aligned to the text column.

### Footer Link Column
**Role:** Site-map navigation in the footer

Vertical stack of 14–15px text links in #838383 (Graphite), 8px row gap. Column heading is 15–16px weight 500 in #202020. Six columns typically: Product, Additional Links, Cap, Use Cases, Socials, Tools.

### Chat Widget
**Role:** Persistent floating support button

Fixed-position, bottom-right. 48px circle, #202020 background, white speech-bubble icon. Sits above all other content with a subtle 0px 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.1) shadow.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use 9999px border-radius for all buttons, nav bar, segmented controls, and tags — the pill shape is the signature silhouette.
- Pair the two-button CTA cluster as black (#202020) 'Download' on the left and blue (#2563eb) 'Upgrade' on the right; never invert this order.
- Set hero and section display headings at 52–60px, weight 700, with natural (0) letter-spacing and 1.07–1.11 line-height — tight, confident, no breath wasted.
- Use 0.2em letter-spacing at 11–12px weight 500 for all uppercase eyebrow labels above feature titles.
- Default to white (#fcfcfc) surfaces with 1px #e0e0e0 or #e5e7eb borders for separation; reach for shadows only on elevated cards and the floating chat widget.
- Keep the product mockup window and decorative ribbon artwork as the only place where multi-color gradients appear — the UI chrome stays monochrome plus one blue.
- Set page max-width to 1200px with ~20px horizontal padding; hero is always a two-column split (text left, product visual right) at this width.

### Don't
- Do not fill CTAs with any color other than #202020 (ownership) or #2563eb (upgrade) — the two-color button system is the entire decision architecture.
- Do not use the Spark Violet (#7c3aed), Ember (#d97706), or Sky (#0d74ce) accent colors for buttons, links, or interactive states — they are decorative only.
- Do not add shadows to cards inside the main content flow; use a 1px #e0e0e0 border instead. Shadows are reserved for the floating chat widget and the download CTA card.
- Do not set body text below 14px or above 16px — the body type is narrow by design.
- Do not use pure #ffffff for the page background; use #fcfcfc (Paper) so the canvas sits gently below content.
- Do not place multi-color gradients in buttons, badges, nav, or footer; gradients live exclusively inside the product mockup artwork.
- Do not break the 9999px pill convention for primary actions — the only valid card radii are 12px (feature card) and 16px (download CTA card).

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 0 | Page Canvas | `#fcfcfc` | The dominant site background; nearly white with the faintest warmth so content sits slightly forward. |
| 1 | Card Surface | `#fcfcfc` | Identical to the canvas — separation comes from 1px borders, not background shifts. |
| 2 | Subtle Wash | `#e5e7eb` | A barely-visible cool-gray tint used behind the download CTA card to create a contained-block effect. |
| 3 | Inset Track | `#f0f0f0` | The segmented control track, subtle button hover, and any place needing a step-down from the main surface. |
| 4 | Blue Tint | `#e0ecfc` | The only chromatic surface — a pale blue wash used for the glow ring behind the play button in the product mockup. |

## Elevation

- **Floating Nav Bar:** `inset rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2) 0px 1.5px 0px 0px`
- **Primary Buttons (both variants):** `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05) 0px 4px 10px 0px`
- **Download CTA Card:** `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05) 0px 20px 25px -5px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05) 0px 8px 10px -6px`
- **Chat Widget:** `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 10px 15px -3px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 4px 6px -4px`
- **Active Segmented Control Segment:** `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05) 0px 4px 10px 0px`

## Imagery

Visuals are concentrated in the hero product mockup — a full app-window screenshot showing the recording interface with a large blue play-button overlay ringed by a soft glow. The mockup uses macOS window-chrome conventions (traffic-light dots, title bar) to signal native-app credibility. Behind the play button, a dark abstract wave/ribbon illustration in gradients (blue→cyan, pink→orange, violet→pink) adds chromatic energy without competing with the UI. Trust logos appear as a monochrome gray strip (~32px height) below the hero. No lifestyle photography, no full-bleed editorial images — the product IS the hero. Iconography throughout is outlined, 1.5–2px stroke weight, monoline geometric style.

## Layout

Max-width 1200px centered layout with ~20px horizontal padding. The hero is always a two-column asymmetric split: text column on the left (55%) and product mockup on the right (45%), vertically centered. Below the hero, sections alternate between centered single-column text blocks (like 'One app, every workflow') and two-column feature explanations (text left, visual right). The segmented mode selector sits centered as a horizontal tab bar. Section gaps are generous (~80px) with seamless white-to-white flow — no alternating background bands. The footer is a six-column link grid with a bordered card wrapping the final download CTAs. The nav bar is a floating pill, centered at the top with margin from the viewport edge. Density is compact in components (8–12px gaps) but spacious at the section level.
