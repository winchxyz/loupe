# OLIPOP — Style Reference
> Retro apothecary cream and forest teal — a soda fountain menu printed on warm paper.

**Theme:** light

OLIPOP is a sun-faded apothecary meets soda fountain: warm cream canvases, one authoritative forest-teal that anchors every header, button, and brand mark, and a carousel of pastel-flavored product cards that read like candy shelf labels from a 1950s general store. Typography does most of the storytelling — a high-contrast retro display serif (WindsorEF) at weight 800 shouts from headlines, while a clean modern sans (Ano) handles everything else with workmanlike quietness. The system lives in the gap between vintage warmth and modern e-commerce utility: pill-shaped buttons, soft 16px-radius cards, and zero shadows except a single faint glow on the primary call-to-action. Color is rationed carefully — most of the page is cream and forest teal, with chromatic energy reserved for product cards, a single wine-red accent, and a bright teal secondary action.

## Tokens — Colors

| Name | Value | Token | Role |
|------|-------|-------|------|
| Forest Ink | `#14433d` | `--color-forest-ink` | Teal supporting accent for decorative details and low-frequency emphasis. Do not promote it to the primary CTA color |
| Cream Paper | `#fdf7e7` | `--color-cream-paper` | Page canvas, section backgrounds — the off-white that every surface sits on, slightly warm so type never feels clinical |
| Mint Sage | `#d3e8e3` | `--color-mint-sage` | Hero panel background, soft section washes — a desaturated mint that recedes so forest-teal text can lead |
| Charcoal | `#3a3a3a` | `--color-charcoal` | Body text, link text, secondary icons — softer than pure black to stay in harmony with the warm cream canvas |
| Pure White | `#ffffff` | `--color-pure-white` | Card surfaces on cream sections, button text on forest-teal fills, input fields — the only true white in the system |
| Hairline Gray | `#e3e3e3` | `--color-hairline-gray` | Dividers, subtle borders — barely-there structural lines |
| Wine Press | `#7e0022` | `--color-wine-press` | Red supporting accent for decorative details and low-frequency emphasis. |
| Bright Teal | `#2ad2c9` | `--color-bright-teal` | Teal supporting accent for decorative details and low-frequency emphasis. Do not promote it to the primary CTA color |

- **Section gap:** 40-64px
- **Card padding:** 20px
- **Element gap:** 8-16px

## Components

### Announcement Bar
**Role:** Site-wide top banner for promotions and shipping notices

Full-width forest-teal (#14433d) bar with white (#ffffff) text. White (Ano) at 12–14px, centered. Fixed at 1px or 2px vertical padding. Functions as a dark anchor strip at the very top of every page.

### Primary Navigation
**Role:** Main site navigation

Cream (#fdf7e7) background, centered OLIPOP wordmark logo in forest-teal, nav links (Shop, Learn, Subscribe) left-aligned in charcoal (#3a3a3a) Ano weight 400 at ~14–16px, utility icons (Find in Store, account, cart) right-aligned. Spacing of ~20px horizontal padding on link groups.

### Primary CTA Button
**Role:** Highest-priority conversion button

Pill-shaped (50px border-radius), forest-teal (#14433d) fill, white (#ffffff) text in Ano weight 700 at 16px. Padding 12px 24px. Subtle box-shadow rgba(0,0,0,0.1) 0px 0px 24px 0px — a soft ambient glow rather than a hard elevation. Used for 'Shop Now' and main purchase actions.

### Secondary CTA Button
**Role:** Secondary conversion — loyalty/rewards sign-up

Pill-shaped (50px border-radius), bright teal (#2ad2c9) fill, forest-teal (#14433d) text in Ano weight 700 at 16px. Same padding as primary. The vivid teal against the cream page makes it pop without using the dominant brand color.

### Ghost Text Link
**Role:** Inline links within body text

No background or border. Charcoal (#3a3a3a) text, Ano weight 400, underlined or with subtle color shift on hover. Compact, unobtrusive, treats links as text continuity rather than interactive chrome.

### Hero Panel
**Role:** Above-the-fold brand statement section

Two-tone: cream (#fdf7e7) page background with an inset mint-sage (#d3e8e3) rounded panel (24px radius) taking up roughly 40% of the viewport width. Display serif (WindsorEF) weight 800 at 72–80px in forest-teal. Subtext in Ano weight 400 at 18px in charcoal. Primary CTA button below. The mint panel creates a 'card' on a card effect — the hero reads as a poster pinned to cream paper.

### Flavor Product Card
**Role:** Product listing card in the 'Pure Nostalgia-ahh' carousel

Full-bleed colored card (one of 15+ pastel flavors — butter yellow, apple green, blush pink, lavender, peach, etc.), 16px border-radius. Contains a circular product photo crop. Card name in WindsorEF weight 700 at 20–24px in forest-teal below the image. Five-star rating row in Ano 12px. No shadow, no border — the color itself defines the card boundary.

### Section Heading
**Role:** Mid-page section titles

WindsorEF weight 800 at 48–52px, forest-teal (#14433d), centered. Minimal subtext in Ano 18px charcoal directly below. The large serif centered on cream creates a poster-like rhythm between sections.

### Rewards Feature Section
**Role:** Loyalty/rewards promotion with image and text

Cream background. Two-column layout: left column is a large circular image area (rounded illustration with pink, cherry-red, and cream elements), right column has a small wine-red (#7e0022) accent label ('Cherry on Top'), then a WindsorEF display heading at 32–48px, then body copy, then a bright-teal CTA button. The circular image container is a signature layout device — image cropped to a perfect circle, floating on cream.

### Product Image Circle
**Role:** Circular product or illustration container

Perfectly round container (border-radius 50%) holding product photography or illustration. Used within flavor cards and the rewards section. The circle motif appears repeatedly — it softens the rectangular grid and references vintage bottle caps and medallions.

### Form Input Field
**Role:** Newsletter signup, search, and form inputs

White (#ffffff) fill, fountain-teal (#008b70) 1px border, 50px border-radius (pill-shaped), Ano 16px text, 12–16px vertical padding. Focus state deepens border to forest-teal (#14433d).

### Star Rating
**Role:** Product review star display

Five small filled stars in forest-teal (#14433d), inline with product cards. No background, no container — raw characters in Ano 12px or as SVG icons. Functional micro-element, not a decorative badge.

### Footer
**Role:** Site-wide footer with links and legal

Forest-teal (#14433d) background with white (#ffffff) text. Multi-column link grid in Ano 14–16px. Logo at top. The dark footer mirrors the announcement bar, framing the page top and bottom with forest-teal bands.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use WindsorEF at weight 800 or 900 for all headlines 32px and above — this display serif IS the brand voice
- Set primary CTA buttons to 50px border-radius (full pill) with forest-teal (#14433d) fill and white text
- Use cream (#fdf7e7) as the base page background for all sections — never pure white as the canvas
- Apply 16px border-radius to all content cards, 50px to all interactive elements (buttons, inputs, tags)
- Pair the cream canvas with one chromatic surface per product card — each flavor gets its own pastel, never shared
- Keep body text at 16–18px in Ano weight 400 with charcoal (#3a3a3a) — never use pure black on cream
- Use the soft ambient shadow rgba(0,0,0,0.1) 0px 0px 24px only on the primary CTA — all other elements stay flat

### Don't
- Don't use WindsorEF below 20px — the display serif loses character at small sizes and becomes hard to read
- Don't apply sharp corners (0–8px radius) to buttons or inputs — the pill shape is essential to the system
- Don't introduce additional dark surface colors beyond forest-teal (#14433d) — the brand's darkness IS that specific teal
- Don't add heavy drop shadows or elevation effects — the system is fundamentally flat with one exception (primary CTA glow)
- Don't mix the wine-red (#7e0022) accent with forest-teal (#14433d) in the same component — pick one for heading, one for body
- Don't use the product-card pastel colors for UI chrome (nav, buttons, borders) — they are flavor-locked to product context only
- Don't set body text at line-height below 1.4 — Ano needs breathing room to feel warm on cream, not clinical

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 0 | Page Canvas | `#fdf7e7` | Warm cream — the default page background that every other surface sits on |
| 1 | Hero Panel | `#d3e8e3` | Mint sage inset panel within the hero, creating a tonal card on the cream canvas |
| 2 | Product Card | `#fdf4b5` | Pastel flavor-colored cards — each product gets its own hue from the 15-color pastel palette |
| 3 | Dark Frame | `#14433d` | Forest-teal announcement bar and footer — dark bookends that bracket the cream page |

## Elevation

- **Primary CTA Button:** `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 0px 24px 0px`

## Imagery

Product photography is the dominant visual: full-can soda shots on clean pastel backgrounds, tightly cropped with no lifestyle context. The can IS the hero — no hands, no people, no environment. Supporting illustrations appear in the rewards section with a retro/folk-art style (cherry stem, varsity jacket, milkshake glass with sparkle motifs), rendered in flat color blocks of pink, cherry red, and cream. Iconography is minimal — the brand relies on the wordmark and product photography rather than an icon system. The circle motif recurs throughout: product images, illustration containers, and the logo's wordmark treatment. The visual language is 'vintage packaging photography meets folk-art merch' — warm, slightly nostalgic, and proudly analog.

## Agent Prompt Guide

**Quick Color Reference**
- text: #3a3a3a (charcoal body) / #14433d (forest-teal headings)
- background: #fdf7e7 (cream canvas)
- border: #e3e3e3 (hairline gray)
- accent: #7e0022 (wine red — for loyalty/specialness)
- secondary action: #2ad2c9 (bright teal — for rewards sign-up only)
- primary action: no distinct CTA color

**Example Component Prompts**
No distinct primary action color was observed; use the extracted neutral button treatments instead of inventing a filled CTA color.
2. Create a flavor product card: 16px border-radius, fill #fdf4b5 (butter yellow). Centered circular product image crop (border-radius 50%) in the upper 70%. Product name 'Banana Cream' in WindsorEF weight 700 at 20px, #14433d, centered below image. Five forest-teal star icons (12px) at the bottom.
4. Create a section heading: WindsorEF weight 800 at 48px, #14433d, centered on cream. Subtext in Ano weight 400 at 18px #3a3a3a directly below with 16px gap.
5. Create a footer: forest-teal (#14433d) full-width band, white (#ffffff) text, four-column link grid in Ano 14px weight 400. OLIPOP wordmark logo at top in white.

## Circle Motif System

The circle is a recurring structural device throughout OLIPOP: product images are cropped to perfect circles, the rewards illustration sits in a large circular container, the logo's wordmark 'O' reinforces the motif, and the '50px' button/input radius creates pill shapes that echo the same rounded geometry. When building new screens, use circles for: product thumbnails, illustration containers, avatar/badge placements, and decorative background elements. Avoid using circles for primary content containers — the cream canvas and rectangular mint panels handle that role. The circle reads as 'vintage bottle cap / medallion / stamp' and is core to the brand's nostalgic identity.

## Product Card Color System

Each OLIPOP flavor is assigned a unique pastel hue used exclusively as that product's card background. The 15-card palette ranges from warm yellows (#fdf4b5, #fee6a7, #fee967) through pinks (#febac4, #ffada5, #f8d5c0) and corals (#ffc3b3) to greens (#95d95d, #a9df71, #e1eab4) and lavender (#e3d2ed). These colors are flavor-locked: they appear only on product cards, never on UI chrome, buttons, or section backgrounds. When creating a new product, assign a new pastel from this hue family — never reuse a flavor's color. The card color IS the product's identity in the grid.
