# Petertarka — Style Reference
> curated gallery on warm concrete — every card a framed print, every margin deliberate, every type weight a whisper

**Theme:** light

Petertarka presents a curated gallery aesthetic: a warm light gray canvas anchors a two-column grid where every project card feels like a framed print. Typography whispers at weight 200-300 in GT America — ultra-light headlines that gain authority through restraint rather than volume, a deliberate anti-convention against the SaaS standard of bold display type. Color is monastic: the system is almost entirely achromatic, with occasional full-bleed color blocks acting as project identifiers rather than brand expression. The signature move is a colorful 3D illustration that breaks the grid by overlapping card boundaries — one moment of visual exuberance against the quiet monochrome. Sharp corners (zero border-radius), 1px hairline borders, and 45px internal padding create an editorial, almost architectural feel — more museum wall than web page.

## Tokens — Colors

| Name | Value | Token | Role |
|------|-------|-------|------|
| Warm Concrete | `#eaeaea` | `--color-warm-concrete` | Page canvas — the warm light gray that makes the whole gallery feel architectural rather than digital |
| Bone | `#f0f0f0` | `--color-bone` | Card surface — barely distinguishable from the canvas, creating the illusion of cards floating in space |
| Hairline | `#d8d8d8` | `--color-hairline` | 1px card borders and dividers — structural, never decorative |
| Obsidian | `#000000` | `--color-obsidian` | All text, heading borders, and the top/bottom hairline rules that frame the page |
| Paper | `#ffffff` | `--color-paper` | Nav text and link borders — appears in the hamburger menu area and link underlines |

## Components

### Project Card (Neutral)
**Role:** The structural unit of the gallery — a framed print for each project

Background #f0f0f0, 1px solid #d8d8d8 border, 0px border-radius, 45px padding on all sides. Contains a category label (16px GT America 300, top-left), project name (38px GT America 200, left-aligned), and year (16px GT America 300, bottom-right, line-height 2.37 to push it to the card's lower edge). Cards butt directly against each other — the 1px borders form a continuous grid lattice.

### Project Card (Color Block)
**Role:** Variant where the card interior is filled with a project-specific color instead of #f0f0f0

Same dimensions, padding (45px), and border (1px solid #d8d8d8) as the neutral card. Background is a solid project color (e.g. muted violet, sage green). Text remains #000000. These are the only chromatic elements in the system — each one is a one-off, not a repeating accent.

### Year Label
**Role:** Timestamp anchored to the bottom-right corner of each card

16px GT America weight 300, #000000, line-height 2.37. The loose line-height pushes the year to the visual bottom of the 45px-padded card, creating a consistent baseline across the grid regardless of how much content the card holds.

### Category Tag
**Role:** Small descriptor at the top of each card (e.g. 'Print and Digital')

16px GT America weight 300, #000000, no background, no border, no padding. Sits at the top-left of the card interior, aligned to the 45px padding edge.

### Project Title
**Role:** The name of the project — the only large text in the system

38px GT America weight 200, #000000, line-height 1.00. Left-aligned within the card's 45px padding. The ultra-light weight at 38px is the signature: the type appears to hover rather than sit on the page.

### Hamburger Menu
**Role:** The only navigation element — minimal, almost invisible

Two thin horizontal black lines (#000000, ~1.5px stroke) in the top-right corner of the page. No background, no border, no padding. Vertically stacked with a small gap. This is the entire navigation — no logo, no links, no visible affordance beyond the lines.

### 3D Illustration Overlay
**Role:** Signature layout element — a full-color 3D render that breaks the grid

A large, colorful 3D rendered scene (room/space with furniture, plants, objects) positioned to overlap multiple grid cards. Uses vivid pinks, oranges, yellows, greens, and teals — the only place saturated color appears in the system. Sits above the grid (z-index highest), partially obscuring card content. This is not a repeatable component — it is a one-off compositional device for the portfolio's hero moment.

### Top/Bottom Page Rules
**Role:** Horizontal black hairlines that frame the entire page

1px solid #000000 horizontal lines running the full viewport width at the very top and very bottom of the page. The page is literally framed like a print.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use GT America weight 200 for all display-level text (38px). The whisper-weight is the brand voice — never substitute 400 or 500 here.
- Set card padding to exactly 45px on all four sides. This generous interior is what makes the grid feel like framed art.
- Use 0px border-radius everywhere. Sharp corners are non-negotiable — they signal editorial, architectural intent over soft SaaS convention.
- Use 1px solid #d8d8d8 for all card borders. Depth comes from hairlines, never from shadows or background contrast.
- Anchor year labels at line-height 2.37 to push them to the visual bottom of cards regardless of content height.
- Keep the system achromatic. If color appears, it is a full-bleed project card or a singular illustration — never a button, badge, or UI accent.
- Let the hamburger menu be the only navigation visible. No logos, no nav bars, no link lists in the default state.

### Don't
- Do not use bold or semibold weights (600+) anywhere — not for headings, not for CTAs, not for emphasis. Weight 200-400 is the system ceiling.
- Do not add box-shadow, drop-shadow, or any elevation effect to cards. Depth is 1px borders only.
- Do not use border-radius greater than 0px on cards, buttons, tags, or images. Sharp edges define the gallery aesthetic.
- Do not introduce a chromatic accent color for buttons, links, or interactive states. Interactive elements inherit #000000 text and #ffffff borders from the monochromatic system.
- Do not use a max-width container. The grid and its hairlines should run edge-to-edge of the viewport at all breakpoints.
- Do not add gradients to UI surfaces. The single detected gradient is a one-off content element, not a design token.
- Do not use color for status indicators (success, error, warning). The system has no semantic color vocabulary — state changes happen through weight, position, or border style only.

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 0 | Warm Concrete | `#eaeaea` | Page canvas — the warm gray backdrop for the entire gallery |
| 1 | Bone | `#f0f0f0` | Card surface — subtle lift from canvas via 1px hairline border rather than contrast shift |

## Elevation

Zero shadows. Depth is created exclusively through 1px hairline borders (#d8d8d8) against the canvas. Cards do not float — they are framed. This is an anti-elevation design: flat, architectural, and deliberately resistant to the Material/Fluent card-lift convention.

## Imagery

The site uses exactly one type of imagery: highly saturated, colorful 3D renders of interior/exterior spaces with stylized furniture, plants, and objects. These renders are the sole chromatic element in an otherwise achromatic system — they function as a counterpoint, not as decoration. Treatment: overlapping the grid (breaking card boundaries), rounded forms within the render itself but no border-radius on the render container, always positioned to span multiple grid cells. The renders are illustrative/sculptural rather than photographic — they read as designed objects, not captured moments. No photography, no flat illustration, no icons-as-imagery. The rest of the site is pure typography and white space.

## Layout

Full-bleed two-column grid (50/50 split) that runs the entire viewport width with no max-width constraint. Cards in adjacent columns share a 1px #d8d8d8 border that forms a continuous vertical and horizontal lattice. The grid is the primary structural device — no separate sections, no alternating bands, no distinct header/footer areas beyond the 1px black hairlines that frame the page top and bottom. A single 3D illustration overlaps the grid at the top of the page, breaking the lattice for one compositional moment. Navigation is a hamburger icon in the top-right corner. The page reads as a single continuous grid of framed projects, scrolled vertically, with no page-level section breaks.

## Agent Prompt Guide

**Quick Color Reference**
- text: #000000
- background: #eaeaea
- card surface: #f0f0f0
- border: #d8d8d8
- nav/link: #ffffff
- primary action: no distinct CTA color

**Example Component Prompts**

1. Create a project card: 1px solid #d8d8d8 border, #f0f0f0 background, 0px radius, 45px padding all sides. Category label at 16px GT America weight 300 #000000 at top-left. Project title at 38px GT America weight 200 #000000, line-height 1.0, left-aligned. Year label at 16px GT America weight 300 #000000 with line-height 2.37, bottom-right.

2. Create a color block project card: same dimensions and 45px padding as the neutral card, 0px radius, 1px solid #d8d8d8 border, but fill the background with a single solid project color (e.g. #7ec99a sage green or #806d80 muted violet). All text remains #000000.

3. Create a page frame: 1px solid #000000 horizontal line at the very top and very bottom of the viewport, full-bleed, no margin. The rest of the page is #eaeaea canvas with a two-column grid of bordered cards.

4. Create a hamburger menu: two 1.5px-thick #000000 horizontal lines, ~20px wide, vertically stacked with a 6px gap, positioned top-right with 20px margin. No background, no border, no label.

5. Create a type specimen: 38px GT America weight 200 #000000, line-height 1.0, letter-spacing normal. The text should appear to float — extremely thin strokes, no optical adjustment needed because GT America is already drawn for this weight.

## Design Philosophy

Petertarka is a portfolio that behaves like a museum. The system is intentionally constrained: one typeface, three weights, four neutrals, zero shadows, zero radius, zero accent color. Every decision removes something. The result is not minimalism for its own sake — it is curation. The 3D illustration is the only moment the system allows itself to be loud, and that contrast is what makes the rest feel quiet. When building new pages: resist the urge to add. If a component doesn't serve the gallery metaphor (frame, print, wall, hairline, whisper), it probably doesn't belong here.
