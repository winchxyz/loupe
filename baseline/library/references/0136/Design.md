# Copy — Style Reference
> violet voltage on white blueprint

**Theme:** light

Copy.ai operates as a sunlit enterprise platform: white canvas, crisp black text, and a single vivid violet that acts as electric punctuation across an otherwise quiet monochrome interface. The design language is assertive but restrained — heavy display weights in a custom grotesque deliver headlines with presence, while a universal 4px radius keeps every surface sharp and architectural rather than soft. Depth comes from a violet gradient hero band and inset hairline shadows on buttons, not from drop shadows or skeuomorphism. Components are flat, dense with information, and grid-aligned, with cards sitting on white rather than tinted surfaces to maintain contrast discipline.

## Tokens — Colors

## Components

### Primary CTA Button
**Role:** Hero and nav-level call-to-action across the platform.

Filled violet button with Voltage Violet (#693edf) background, white text in Inter 600 at 14-16px, 4px border-radius, 16px vertical / 24px horizontal padding. Inset top shadow (rgba(204, 217, 224, 0.2) 0px -3px 0px 0px inset) creates a pressed-in edge that is signature to this system — the button looks slightly recessed rather than raised. Text is Paper (#ffffff).

### Ghost/Text Link Button
**Role:** Secondary actions and inline navigation links.

Transparent background with Iron (#566b76) text in Inter 500 at 14-14px, no border, 4px radius. Sits inline with Primary CTAs as a secondary action (e.g., 'Learn more' next to 'Get Demo').

### Outlined Ghost Button
**Role:** Low-emphasis interactive elements.

Transparent background with Mist (#ccd9e0) 1px border, Obsidian (#171717) text in Inter 500 at 14px, 4px radius, 16px/20px padding. Same inset shadow treatment as primary button for consistency.

### Hero Gradient Band
**Role:** Full-width violet band serving as the dominant visual anchor on the homepage.

A full-bleed horizontal band with a linear gradient flowing from Voltage Violet (#693edf) at top through Deep Iris (#4f1bb7), Plum Voltage (#4514a6), Royal Purple (#3b0d96), down to Indigo Abyss (#29007a). White text in ABC Normal sits on the gradient. Contains 4 white dot-pipeline connectors (Create Content, Generate Pipeline, Execute Campaigns, Close Deals) and a floating white email-capture card with a dark CTA.

### Feature Card (Playbook Grid)
**Role:** Grid card presenting an AI playbook/use-case.

White (#ffffff) card on the Snow (#f6fafb) page background. 4px border-radius, 24px internal padding, no drop shadow, separated by whitespace alone. Contains two small violet-tinted category tags (SALES, MARKETING, OPERATIONS) at top, ABC Normal heading at 24-28px, body description in Inter 14-16px, and inline ghost/primary button pair at the bottom.

### Category Tag Badge
**Role:** Small labels atop feature cards and section headers.

Lavender Mist (#c1b9f4) background with deeper violet text, or outlined variant with Cobalt Vein (#7249f1) border. Inter 600 at 12px, uppercase tracking, 4px radius, 4px/8px padding. Functions as taxonomic color-coding across the playbook grid.

### Email Capture Input
**Role:** Hero band lead-capture form.

White (#ffffff) background, 1px Ice (#e4edf1) border, 4px radius, 16px padding. Inter 400 placeholder text at 16px in a muted gray. Pairs with a dark filled submit button inside the same card container.

### Platform Architecture Diagram
**Role:** Visual representation of the GTM AI Platform product layers.

A multi-cell diagram on a violet gradient background (Deep Iris → Royal Purple). Each cell has a white heading (ABC Normal, 24px), a description in Inter 14px, and sits on semi-transparent darker violet panels with 4px radius. No drop shadows — depth comes purely from the gradient color shift between cells.

### Navigation Bar
**Role:** Top-of-page persistent navigation.

White (#ffffff) background, 64-72px height, horizontal layout with logo left, centered menu items (Platform, Use cases, Resources, Pricing, GTM AI) with dropdown chevrons, and right-aligned Login link + Primary CTA button. Nav text in Inter 500 at 14-16px, Iron color. No visible bottom border — separation is by background contrast alone.

### Announcement Banner
**Role:** Top-of-page promotional strip.

Dark background (Obsidian #171717 or similar dark) with white text in Inter 500 at 13-14px, white CTA button on the right. Full-width, ~40px height. Used for product launches and report releases.

### Section Header Block
**Role:** Standardized heading + subheading at the top of content sections.

Left-aligned ABC Normal heading at 48-56px in Ink (#000b0f), with a Inter 400 subheading in Iron (#566b76) at 16-18px below. Tight 24-32px gap between heading and subtext. No decorative elements — relies on type contrast alone.

### Integration Logo Strip
**Role:** Horizontal row of partner/integration logos.

A single row of desaturated or grayscale logos (Salesforce, HubSpot, Gong, Zapier, Outreach, etc.) on white or violet background. No borders or cards — logos sit freely with 24-32px column gaps.

### Trusted By Counter
**Role:** Social proof line beneath the hero.

Single line of Inter 400 text in Iron color, 14px, with the number '17 million' bolded in Obsidian. Left-aligned, no decorative iconography.

### Footer
**Role:** Bottom-of-page site map and legal links.

Dark or white background depending on page, multi-column link grid, Inter 400 at 14px in Iron. Column headers in Inter 600 at 14px in Obsidian.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use ABC Normal for all headings 24px and above; never substitute with Inter for display sizes
- Set all border-radii to 4px — buttons, cards, inputs, badges, images all share the same sharp architectural corner
- Use the violet gradient (#693edf → #29007a) only for full-width hero bands and product diagram cells, never for buttons or small elements
- Apply the inset top shadow (rgba(204, 217, 224, 0.2) 0px -3px 0px inset) to all interactive button variants for consistent pressed-edge treatment
- Set body text in Inter 400 at 16px with -0.005em letter-spacing; never use ABC Normal for body copy
- Use Voltage Violet (#693edf) as the sole accent color for CTAs, active states, and category badges — never introduce additional brand hues
- Maintain white card surfaces on Snow (#f6fafb) page canvas with whitespace separation; avoid drop shadows on cards

### Don't
- Do not use drop shadows for card elevation — this system separates layers by background color contrast alone
- Do not use border-radii larger than 4px anywhere in the interface; soft/rounded shapes break the architectural language
- Do not place body text below 14px or above 16px in the Inter scale
- Do not apply the violet gradient to small UI elements like tags, icons, or hover states — it is reserved for hero-scale surfaces
- Do not use multiple accent colors; the palette is deliberately monochrome with one violet voltage point
- Do not use italic or decorative typefaces; both ABC Normal and Inter are set in upright weights only
- Do not center-align body paragraphs or feature card descriptions — left-align with tight 1.4-1.5 line-height

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Page Canvas | `#f6fafb` | Base page background; off-white with subtle cool tint to soften without going gray |
| 2 | Card Surface | `#ffffff` | Feature cards, navigation bar, input fields, and all raised content layers |
| 3 | Hero Gradient Band | `#693edf` | Full-width hero section gradient surface; the only chromatic surface in the system |
| 4 | Platform Diagram Cells | `#4f1bb7` | Darker violet cell backgrounds for product architecture visualization |
| 5 | Dark Announcement Strip | `#171717` | Top promotional banner; dark accent surface for time-sensitive content |

## Elevation

- **Primary CTA Button:** `inset 0 -3px 0 0 rgba(204, 217, 224, 0.2)`
- **Outlined Ghost Button:** `inset 0 -3px 0 0 rgba(204, 217, 224, 0.2)`

## Imagery

The site uses a hybrid visual language: abstract geometric illustration in the hero (angular violet ribbon shapes with white dot-pipeline connectors and circuit-like nodes) and product/diagram screenshots in the platform section (multi-cell architecture grids on violet backgrounds). All illustration linework uses a restricted palette of violet shades (#693edf, #7249f1, #c1b9f4) and dark neutrals (#535866, #000000), creating a cohesive 'engineering blueprint' aesthetic. Partner logos (Salesforce, HubSpot, OpenAI, Anthropic) appear as flat grayscale marks. There is no photography — the visual system is entirely illustration + UI, which reinforces the technical/infrastructure positioning of the product.

## Layout

Page model is max-width 1200px centered on a Snow (#f6fafb) canvas, with full-bleed sections (hero gradient band, announcement strip) breaking out to the viewport edges. The hero pattern is a split composition: left column carries bold ABC Normal display text (88px headline), right column carries a descriptive paragraph and floating email-capture card, all overlaid on a full-bleed violet gradient band. Section rhythm alternates between white and the off-white canvas with no visible dividers — separation is by whitespace and 80px section gaps. Content arrangement is consistently left-aligned with 2-column text+diagram blocks and a 3-column card grid for the 'Design Your GTM AI Playbook' section. Navigation is a minimal top bar with dropdown menus and a right-aligned CTA.

## Agent Prompt Guide

**Quick Color Reference**
- Text: #171717 (Obsidian) for primary, #566b76 (Iron) for body, #000b0f (Ink) for headings
- Background: #ffffff (Paper) for cards, #f6fafb (Snow) for page canvas
- Border: #e2e8eb (Cloud) for dividers, #e4edf1 (Ice) for input borders, #ccd9e0 (Mist) for button outlines
- Accent: #693edf (Voltage Violet) for CTAs, active states, and category badges
- primary action: no distinct CTA color

**3-5 Example Component Prompts**

1. **Hero section**: Full-bleed gradient band from #693edf to #29007a (top to bottom). ABC Normal display headline at 56-88px weight 600, #ffffff, letter-spacing -1.12px to -1.76px. Subtext at 18px Inter 400, #ffffff at 80% opacity. White email-capture card (24px padding, 4px radius) with a light input field and dark submit button.

2. **Feature card grid (3-column)**: White (#ffffff) card on Snow (#f6fafb) page. 4px radius, 24px padding, no shadow. Top: two badges with #c1b9f4 background and #693edf text, Inter 600 12px uppercase. Heading: ABC Normal 24px weight 500, #000b0f. Body: Inter 400 14px, #566b76. Bottom: ghost link 'Learn more' (#566b76) beside a small outlined 'Get Demo' button.

No distinct primary action color was observed; use the extracted neutral button treatments instead of inventing a filled CTA color.

4. **Section header**: ABC Normal 48px weight 600 in #000b0f, letter-spacing -0.96px. Below it, Inter 400 18px in #566b76, max-width 640px. 80px margin-top from previous section, 40px gap between heading and subtext.

5. **Platform architecture diagram cell**: Background #4f1bb7 (violet cell), 4px radius, 24px padding. Heading in ABC Normal 24px weight 500, white. Description in Inter 400 14px, white at 85% opacity. Arranged in a 3x2 or 4x2 grid with 8px gaps between cells.

## Gradient System

The gradient is a fixed 5-stop linear progression used exclusively for the hero band and platform architecture diagrams:

linear-gradient(180deg, #693edf 0%, #4f1bb7 25%, #4514a6 50%, #3b0d96 75%, #29007a 100%)

This is not a decorative flourish — it is a structural element that defines the product's visual identity. The gradient always flows top-to-bottom (not diagonal) and the stops are evenly distributed. Never truncate, skew, or recolor this gradient. It should only appear on full-bleed horizontal bands, not on cards, buttons, or small surfaces.

## Similar Brands

- **Linear** — Same custom geometric grotesque for display type, flat white card surfaces, and absence of drop shadows in favor of background contrast for elevation
- **Vercel** — Identical monochrome-with-single-accent strategy, ultra-clean navigation, and high-contrast black-on-white type hierarchy with negative letter-spacing on headlines
- **Retool** — Same architectural product-platform aesthetic with grid-based feature cards, inset button shadows, and a 4px universal border-radius system
- **Grafana** — Similar dark-on-light contrast discipline with violet/purple accent system, and the use of full-bleed gradient bands as primary visual anchors
- **Resend** — Matches the sharp 4px radius system, bold display headlines, and the 'engineering blueprint' visual treatment with geometric illustration accents
