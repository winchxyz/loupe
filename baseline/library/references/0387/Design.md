# Branding — Style Reference
> Black gallery wall, blood-red punctuation — Oversized white display type floats on a void-like dark canvas, interrupted by a single vivid red accent and dramatic ornamental display faces that feel like gallery signage rather than web UI.

**Theme:** dark

SVZ operates in the visual register of a high-fashion editorial: pitch-black canvas, oversized display typography that dominates the viewport, and a single arterial red that appears like a wound in the monochrome. The interface is deliberately sparse — most surfaces carry no chrome at all, letting type, photographic collage, and oversized background shapes do the work. Text is primarily white on near-black, with an off-white (#f3efef) reserved for inverted bodies and footers. Hierarchy is achieved through scale (160px display stepping down to 10px labels) and weight contrast (300 whisper-thin body against 700 blocky caps), never through color or chrome. Every interactive element is ghost or hairline-bordered — the system refuses to shout with buttons, preferring arrows and discover-call links that feel like editorial pull-quotes.

## Tokens — Colors

| Name | Value | Token | Role |
|------|-------|-------|------|
| Void Canvas | `#080808` | `--color-void-canvas` | Primary page background; the base upon which all display type and floating shapes sit |
| Absolute Black | `#000000` | `--color-absolute-black` | Deepest surface, decorative fills, icon strokes — the floor beneath the void |
| Charcoal Plate | `#171617` | `--color-charcoal-plate` | Footer and inverted section backgrounds, slightly elevated off the base void |
| Smoke Plate | `#262525` | `--color-smoke-plate` | Secondary surface for content blocks and image treatments layered over the void |

| Bone White | `#fcfcfc` | `--color-bone-white` | Primary text, hairline borders, icon outlines — the dominant non-black color in the system |
| Linen | `#f3efef` | `--color-linen` | Inverted body sections, off-white text on dark cards, soft warm-white content surfaces |
| Ash | `#d4d2d2` | `--color-ash` | Muted secondary text, nav labels, subtle borders — the whispered voice between bone and graphite |
| Pebble | `#b5b2b2` | `--color-pebble` | Disabled borders, tertiary helper text, low-priority metadata |
| Iron | `#525252` | `--color-iron` | Link underlines, nav dividers, hairline separators on dark surfaces |
| Arterial Red | `#fe1e34` | `--color-arterial-red` | Sole brand accent — card borders, cursor, hero dot, gradient terminator; the only saturated color and it is used like a heartbeat, not a coat of paint |
| Crimson Pure | `#ff0000` | `--color-crimson-pure` | Heading underline accent and decorative fill — a purer red for typographic emphasis only |

## Tokens — Typography

### Kmr Waldenburg — Primary display and UI typeface across nav, headings, body, buttons, and the full scale from 10px tracked nav labels to 160px hero display. The custom face is the system's signature — its bold caps at 64–160px carry negative tracking (-0.075em to -0.080em) that compresses the letters into architectural blocks.

### Dirtyline 36 Daysoftype 2022 — Ornamental display face used for single-letter or short-word spectacle moments (the stylized 'a' in 'WE ARE').

## Components

### Ghost CTA Link
**Role:** Primary action affordance across the site

Uppercase 12px Kmr Waldenburg weight 400 with 0.071em letter-spacing, bone-white (#fcfcfc) text on void canvas, paired with a 45° arrow icon. No fill, no background, no border. 32px vertical padding, 8px horizontal. Replaces the conventional button entirely — the system treats calls-to-action as editorial pull-quotes, not UI controls.

### Discovery Call Outlined Button
**Role:** Rare filled-style affordance for high-intent actions

Top-right header element: uppercase 12px tracked text inside an 8px-radius rectangle with a 1px hairline border at #d4d2d2 on the void, containing a diagonal arrow. Internal padding 12px 24px. This is the only element that visually resembles a 'button' in the conventional sense — even it is a ghost.

### Hero Display Headline
**Role:** Page-opening typographic statement

160px Kmr Waldenburg weight 700, all caps, line-height 0.90, letter-spacing -12.8px. White (#fcfcfc) on void (#080808). Small Editorialnew italic weight 300 words ('crafting', 'for the') sit inline at 42px between the caps as connective tissue. The two type families are locked at the same baseline grid.

### Section Transition Headline
**Role:** Mid-page typographic punctuation (e.g. 'WE ARE')

80px Kmr Waldenburg weight 700 with -6px tracking, paired with a single oversized ornamental letter from Dirtyline 36 Daysoftype 2022 in 80–160px. The contrast between blocky geometric caps and a hand-drawn calligraphic glyph is the signature moment.

### Bordered Brand Card
**Role:** Highlighted content card using the brand accent

Background: void or smoke (#080808–#262525). Border: 1px solid #fe1e34. Border-radius: 8px. Internal padding: 24px. The red border is the only chromatic border in the system; it functions as a 'featured' marker, not decoration.

### Standard Card
**Role:** Generic content surface

Background #080808 or #f3efef, 1px hairline border at #d4d2d2 (on dark) or #525252 (on light), 8px radius, 12–24px internal padding. Inset highlight: rgba(255,255,255,0.2) 0px 2px 5px 0px inset on dark variants to suggest a glass edge.

### Hairline Link
**Role:** Inline and nav text links

12–14px Kmr Waldenburg weight 400, uppercase, 0.071em tracking. Underline in #525252 (on dark) or #b5b2b2 (on light). 3px border-radius is reserved for link/nav containers only. No color change on hover — the system relies on weight or position shift instead.

### Top Navigation
**Role:** Primary site navigation bar

Full-width, transparent over void canvas. Logo 'SVZ' top-left in 32px Editorialnew or Kmr Waldenburg caps. Four column groups (AGENCY, WORK, CULTURE, INSIGHTS) centered as tracked uppercase labels with stacked sub-items in 12px. Discovery Call outlined button pinned top-right. No background fill — the nav floats on the void.

### Footer Panel
**Role:** Site footer

Charcoal (#171617) background, full-bleed, bone-white text. Mirrors the nav's column structure. 48px vertical padding minimum.

### Accent Dot
**Role:** Scattered red punctuation across the canvas

Solid 16–24px #fe1e34 circle, no border, no shadow. Appears as a cursor-like marker near CTA areas and as visual rhythm against the void. Functions like a drop of blood in the monochrome system.

### Decorative Background Shape
**Role:** Atmospheric large-scale visual element

Oversized geometric forms (crosses, arrows, letters) rendered in #171617 to #262525 with 8–20% perceived opacity, bleeding off-canvas. Establishes editorial composition without competing with foreground type. No interaction.

### Editorial Body Panel
**Role:** Long-form content section

Linen (#f3efef) background, 080808 text, 14px Kmr Waldenburg weight 400, line-height 1.50, 24px section padding. The only high-density reading surface in the system. 1px #d4d2d2 border or seamless transition from a dark section.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Let type carry hierarchy — use 80–160px display sizes for hero moments and 10–12px tracked uppercase for metadata; do not introduce color, chrome, or icons to compensate.
- Use #fe1e34 only as a 1px border on one or two featured elements per page, plus the accent dot — the red must remain rare to function as punctuation.
- Mix Kmr Waldenburg caps at 700 with Editorialnew italic weight 300 on the same baseline for editorial contrast — this two-family dialogue is the signature.
- Maintain 0.90–1.10 line-height on all display sizes; the system uses tight leading to let oversized type feel architectural rather than airy.
- Track 10–12px nav and label text OUT to +0.071em–+0.308em and display text IN to -0.050em–-0.080em — letter-spacing is a load-bearing typographic tool, not decoration.
- Anchor interactive elements with a diagonal arrow icon (↗) rather than color, weight, or background change — hover states should shift position or weight, not hue.
- Use #f3efef as the only surface that escapes the void; light sections feel like turning a page in a magazine.

### Don't
- Do not introduce filled buttons, drop shadows, or gradients on UI elements — the system rejects conventional depth and uses a single white inset highlight at most.
- Do not use #fe1e34 as a text color, background fill, or icon color beyond borders and the single accent dot; spreading the red flattens its meaning.
- Do not use Kmr Waldenburg body weights (300/400) for display headings under 64px — the system reserves 700 weight for sizes 42px and above to preserve impact.
- Do not apply border-radius above 14.4px; the system uses crisp 3px (nav/links) and 8px (cards/buttons) only — rounding is a whisper, not a curve.
- Do not place body text below 14px or above 32px without shifting to a display role; 10–12px is reserved for tracked uppercase labels with no sentence structure.
- Do not combine more than two typeface families in a single composition (Kmr Waldenburg + Editorialnew, or + Dirtyline 36); adding a third breaks the editorial discipline.
- Do not use #000000 as a text color on dark surfaces — the void (#080808) and bone-white (#fcfcfc) pairing is the system's reading contract; pure black text only appears on #f3efef.

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 0 | Void | `#080808` | Page canvas — the absolute floor |
| 1 | Absolute | `#000000` | Deepest surface, behind decorative shapes and image overlays |
| 2 | Charcoal | `#171617` | Footer and inverted content surfaces |
| 3 | Smoke | `#262525` | Elevated content blocks and image treatments |
| 4 | Graphite | `#393939` | Card surface — the only platform that receives the white inset highlight shadow |
| 5 | Linen | `#f3efef` | Inverted body panel — warm-white surface for content contrast |

## Elevation

- **Card (dark variant):** `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2) 0px 2px 5px 0px inset`

## Imagery

Imagery is editorial-collage: large-scale photographic textures (leopard-print heart, animal patterns) and oversized geometric shapes bleeding off-canvas in Smoke (#171617–#262525) tones. Full-bleed, no rounded corners, no contained frames — images occupy the canvas like wallpaper, not thumbnails. Photography is high-contrast, dark/moody, often surreal or fashion-editorial, used to punctuate display type rather than explain product. Iconography is minimal: 1px hairline arrows (↗) and stroked SVGs in bone-white on the void. No illustration, no 3D, no abstract gradients on content.

## Layout

Full-bleed dark canvas with no max-width container — content uses generous internal padding (48–64px section gaps) to feel composed against the void. The hero is a full-viewport moment dominated by 160px display type centered or left-aligned, with the dark background visible around all four edges. Sections alternate between void (#080808) and a single inverted linen (#f3efef) body panel, with 48–80px vertical breathing room. Navigation is a transparent top bar; no sticky header, no sidebar. Content arrangement is editorial: asymmetric, with display headlines set as two- or three-line stacks and small italic connectives. Card grids (when used) are 2–3 columns with 24px gaps, 8px radius, and 1px hairline borders.

## Agent Prompt Guide

**Quick Color Reference**
- text: #fcfcfc
- background: #080808
- border: #d4d2d2 (on dark) / #525252 (on light)
- accent: #fe1e34
- primary action: #fe1e34 (filled action)

**3-5 Example Component Prompts**

1. Create a Primary Action Button: #fe1e34 background, #fcfcfc text, 9999px radius, compact pill padding. Use this filled treatment for the main CTA.

2. Build a featured project card: background #080808, 1px solid #fe1e34 border, 8px border-radius, 24px padding. Headline 'PROJECT NAME' in 24px Kmr Waldenburg weight 700, color #fcfcfc, letter-spacing -0.91px. Body description in 14px Kmr Waldenburg weight 400, color #d4d2d2, line-height 1.50. The red border is the only chromatic chrome — do not add shadows, fills, or icons.

3. Build the top navigation: transparent background over void canvas. Left: logo 'SVZ' in 32px Kmr Waldenburg weight 700 caps, color #fcfcfc. Center: four column headers (AGENCY, WORK, CULTURE, INSIGHTS) in 10px Kmr Waldenburg weight 400 uppercase, tracked +0.8px, color #d4d2d2, each with 2–3 sub-items in 12px same color directly below at 8px row gap. Right: a Discovery Call outlined button — 8px border-radius rectangle with 1px #d4d2d2 border, 12px 24px padding, 'DISCOVERY CALL ↗' in 12px Kmr Waldenburg weight 400 uppercase, color #fcfcfc, tracked +0.85px.

4. Build an inverted body section: background #f3efef, 64px vertical padding. Body text in 14px Kmr Waldenburg weight 400, color #080808, line-height 1.50. Section heading 'EDITORIAL' in 32px Kmr Waldenburg weight 700, color #080808, letter-spacing -1.6px, uppercase. Use this surface sparingly — it is the only escape from the void and should feel like turning a page.

5. Build a 'WE ARE' transition moment: void background, 80px Kmr Waldenburg weight 700 caps spelling 'WE' and 'RE' with extreme letter-spacing -6px, color #fcfcfc, line-height 0.90. Between them, a single ornamental 160px character from Dirtyline 36 Daysoftype 2022 (a stylized 'a' or calligraphic letterform) as a sculptural object — the geometric caps and the hand-drawn glyph must sit on the same baseline with the cap-height of the glyph matching the cap-height of the surrounding letters.
