# JetBrains — Style Reference
> Neon nebula on obsidian — a black-ground page where violet-blue gradients bloom upward like deep-space imagery, punctuated by hot-pink neon and per-product chromatic icon light.

**Theme:** dark

JetBrains' site feels like the interior of a deep-space control room — pure black (#000000) ground plane with electric violet-to-blue gradients erupting from the darkness like bioluminescent nebulae. The defining moves are the chromatic product icon ecosystem (each IDE gets a vivid multicolor badge) floating against near-black surfaces, and the blue radial glow (rgba(0,71,253,0.8) at 75% opacity) diffused behind hero content like a spotlight on a dark stage. Headlines at 72-79px use JetBrains Sans weight 600 with tight letter-spacing, while the hot-pink accent (#f31199, CSS var --main-page-pink) fires only on category labels and brand moments — a neon sign in a dark corridor. Cards use 24px radius with translucent violet or pink fills (rgba(90,31,208,0.3), rgba(243,17,180,0.2)) that glow rather than separate.

## Tokens — Typography

### JetBrains Sans — The single typeface for the entire site at all sizes and weights. 600 at 72-79px for hero headlines — unusual that even at this weight the custom letterSpacing tightening (-0.005em to -0.001em) keeps the large type dense and technical rather than editorial. Weight 300 appears at mid-sizes giving subheadings a lighter counterpoint to bold display text.

## Components

### Hero CTA Button — Primary Dark
**Role:** Main call-to-action on hero sections

White fill (#ffffff), #19191c text, 26px border-radius (pill), 12px top/bottom padding, 32px left/right padding. JetBrains Sans 16px weight 500. Used for 'Choose Your IDE' — solid white stands out starkly against the dark gradient hero.

### CTA Button — Violet Deep
**Role:** Secondary prominent CTA on feature cards

Background #2e106a (Deep Violet), text #18a3fa (Electric Blue), border #7b61ff (Violet Pulse) 1px, 16px border-radius, 24px padding all sides. The neon-blue text on deep-violet background creates an illuminated button that reads like an active screen element inside the IDE itself.

### Ghost Button — White Outlined
**Role:** Navigation links, secondary actions with text context

Background transparent, #ffffff text, 1px #ffffff border, 20px border-radius, 8px padding all sides. Used in nav contexts and as paired secondary to primary CTAs.

### Ghost Link Button — Borderless
**Role:** Nav bar top-level items, inline text actions

Background transparent, #ffffff text, no border (0px radius, 0px top/bottom padding, 10px left/right padding). Pure text with horizontal padding only — becomes a tab-style navigation element.

### Feature Announcement Card
**Role:** Hero carousel cards for product announcements like 'JetBrains IDEs 2026.1'

Background transparent with 1px border #5a1fd0 (Magenta Glow / vivid violet), 24px radius, internal padding 24-64px. Contains product name at 29-35px weight 600, body at 16px #bababb, IDE icon grid at 32px, and a 3D/abstract gradient visual asset on the right half. The violet border glows against black.

### Business Feature Card
**Role:** Gradient content card for audience-segmented sections

Background linear-gradient(130deg, rgb(90,31,208) 10%, rgba(46,16,106,0) 70%) overlaid with organic blob shapes in deep red/purple, 24px radius, 64px padding. White headlines at 35-43px weight 600, #bababb body at 16px, white ghost pill button (26px radius, 32px horizontal padding). The gradient gives the impression of colored light bleeding from within.

### Pink Tinted Feature Card
**Role:** Highlight cards for specific product moments

Background rgba(243,17,180,0.2) (20% opacity Neon Pink), 24px radius, 23px padding. The translucent magenta tint reads as a glowing selection highlight against the dark ground.

### Violet Badge — Filled
**Role:** Status labels like 'Now Live', 'Featured', 'Free for non-commercial use'

Background #6b57ff (Iris), #ffffff text, 4px radius, 1px top/bottom padding, 7px left/right padding, JetBrains Sans 13px weight 500. Sharp-cornered relative to other components — badges are the most rectangular element in the system.

### Violet Badge — Tab Style
**Role:** Contextual tab labels attached to card tops

Background rgba(107,87,255,0.5) (50% opacity Violet Pulse), #ffffff text, border-radius 6px 6px 0px 0px (top-rounded only), 5px top/bottom padding, 11px left/right padding. The flat bottom connects visually to the card it labels.

### IDE Product Icon Badge
**Role:** Per-product identity marks in product grids and navigation

32px square icons with each IDE's distinct multicolor gradient fill (no single token — each product has unique chromatic identity: IntelliJ IDEA uses orange/red/purple, PyCharm uses green/yellow, DataGrip uses teal/dark). Displayed on 16px radius containers. These are the primary chromatic diversity element of the system — the only place vivid orange (#ff8100), vivid green (#00d886), vivid yellow (#f0eb18) appear.

### Navigation Bar
**Role:** Top-level site navigation, always visible

Full-width, 72px height, background #19191c (Deep Charcoal). JetBrains logo mark (multicolor cube icon) + 'JETBRAINS' wordmark in #ffffff weight 500 at 16px, left-aligned. Nav items (#ffffff, no border, 10px horizontal padding) centered. Utility icons (search, account, cart, language) right-aligned in #a3a3a4 at 20px. No border-bottom — the header floats above the hero gradient.

### Carousel Pagination Control
**Role:** Slide navigation for announcement cards

Left/right arrow buttons with transparent background, 1px #474749 border, 20px radius, 8px padding. Counter text '1 / 2' in #bababb at 16px between arrows. Sits below card carousels, horizontally centered.

### Audience Segmentation Tab Row
**Role:** Segment switcher for 'For developers / For teams / For businesses'

Horizontal pill-group container with transparent background, each segment as a ghost button (20px radius). Active segment uses 1px #7b61ff border, #ffffff text. Inactive segments have no border, #bababb text. The group appears as a floating pill selector centered in the content area.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use #000000 as the absolute page background — never a near-black like #0a0a0a or #111; the true black is what makes the gradient glows feel luminous
- Apply the radial blue glow (rgba(0,71,253,0.8) → transparent) behind hero content at ~87% width spread, centered on the content, so text appears spotlit from behind
- Use Neon Pink (#f31199) only for category labels and brand punctuation — 1-3 instances per page maximum; it reads as a signal color, not a fill color
- Set all card and feature panel border-radius to 24px; use 4px only for badges, never mix these on the same component
- Use translucent fills for card backgrounds: rgba(90,31,208,0.3) for violet-tinted cards, rgba(243,17,180,0.2) for pink-tinted cards — never opaque colored fills
- Apply JetBrains Sans with fontFeatureSettings '"calt", "kern", "liga"' active at all sizes, and apply negative letter-spacing (-0.005em) at display sizes 43px and above
- Give each JetBrains product its own distinct multicolor icon — the chromatic icon grid is the primary visual diversity mechanism; do not apply a single brand color to all icons

### Don't
- Do not use #18a3fa (Electric Blue) as a fill color for buttons or large surfaces — it is a text/border/link color only; as a fill it would overpower the dark palette
- Do not add box-shadows to cards — elevation is expressed through gradient fills and translucent backgrounds, never drop shadows
- Do not use border-radius below 16px on interactive elements (buttons, cards); sharp-cornered shapes are reserved exclusively for badges (4-6px)
- Do not place white text directly on the pure black background without a gradient zone or translucent card beneath for longer body text — use #bababb for body on raw black
- Do not use Neon Pink (#f31199) as a background fill for large areas — its opacity 0.2 translucent form (rgba(243,17,180,0.2)) is the maximum surface application
- Do not add a visible border-bottom to the navigation bar — the #19191c header transitions into the hero gradient without a line
- Do not apply uniform icon color — product icons must retain their individual per-product chromatic gradient identity; monochromatic treatment breaks the identity system

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 0 | Void | `#000000` | Absolute page background — the black base from which all gradients emerge |
| 1 | Deep Charcoal | `#19191c` | Navigation bar, footer — surfaces that need to sit above the background but below content cards |
| 2 | Violet Glass | `#2e106a` | Translucent violet card fills (rgba(90,31,208,0.3)) — feature announcement cards, business section panels |
| 3 | Pink Glass | `#45173a` | Translucent pink card fills (rgba(243,17,180,0.2)) — highlight feature cards for specific products |

## Elevation

Zero box-shadows anywhere on the site. Elevation and depth are created exclusively through gradient fills, translucent backgrounds with color tint (rgba violet/pink), and radial glow effects — not shadow casting. A card 'rises' because its colored translucent fill catches the light of the background gradient behind it, not because it casts a shadow below it. This approach keeps the dark theme feeling like illumination from within rather than objects floating above a surface.

## Imagery

Heavy use of abstract 3D rendered data-mesh visuals — luminous wireframe surfaces in pink/purple/blue forming curved grid planes, as seen in the 'JetBrains IDEs 2026.1' announcement card. These renders have no photographic elements; they're pure light-on-dark mathematical geometry suggesting data structures or network topology. Product screenshots are treated as dark-themed UI mockups (the IDE itself shown with dark editor theme) with rounded 8-16px corners, embedded within dark card contexts rather than on white backgrounds. No lifestyle photography or people imagery visible. Icons are 32px product logos with individual per-product multicolor gradient fills — each is a distinct chromatic identity mark, not a unified icon set. The overall image language is code-and-compute: abstract renders + UI screenshots + chromatic product icons, with zero real-world photography.

## Layout

Full-bleed dark canvas with a max-width content container of ~1280px centered. Hero is full-viewport with centered headline text over a radial blue glow, with an IDE screenshot mockup below the fold. Section rhythm moves from the blue-glow hero → card carousel section (full-bleed black) → audience segmentation tabs with gradient feature panels → product grid sections. No alternating light/dark bands — the entire page stays on the dark black ground, with section separation achieved via gradient card backgrounds and spacing (80-120px between sections) rather than background color changes. The 'For businesses' section temporarily shifts to a near-black #19191c ground for contrast. Card grids use 2-column layouts for feature panels and 4-5 column grids for the IDE product icon array. Navigation is a fixed top bar at 72px with logo-left, nav-center, utilities-right structure.

## Gradient System

Five gradient roles operate on the site: (1) HERO GLOW — radial-gradient(87.36% 97.44% at 54.14% 23.32%, rgba(0,71,253,0.8) 0px, rgba(0,71,253,0.8) 15%, rgba(0,0,0,0) 75%) — the defining visual of the homepage, a blue spotlight over absolute black. (2) VIOLET NEBULA — linear-gradient(130deg, rgb(90,31,208) 10%, rgba(46,16,106,0) 70%) — used on announcement card backgrounds, creates directional light bloom. (3) AURORA SWEEP — linear-gradient(90deg, rgb(8,222,170) -12.99%, rgb(0,170,250) 176.77%) — teal-to-blue, used on feature callout headings and icon fills. (4) EMERALD FADE — linear-gradient(130deg, rgba(33,215,137,0.6) -10%, rgba(106,16,70,0) 80%) — green-to-void, used as secondary section accent. (5) PRODUCT ILLUSTRATION — complex teal-to-navy multi-stop gradient (linear-gradient(0deg, rgb(78,197,185) 2.53%, ... rgb(22,24,27) 99.4%)) used in specific product feature visuals. All gradients fade to transparent or near-black — none have hard stops on both ends.
