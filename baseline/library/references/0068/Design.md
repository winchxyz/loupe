# Tuple — Style Reference
> Developer pair-programming workshop — clean white surfaces, one violet CTA, playful multi-color accents, and a dark band that makes the light sections breathe.

**Theme:** light

Tuple's design language is a developer's pair-programming workshop: bright, airy light surfaces with a single confident violet CTA that makes the primary action unmistakable. The visual identity leans on a four-color accent palette — violet, blue, orange, green — used sparingly as headings, icons, and the product-screenshot wallpapers, while the structural UI stays zinc-neutral and quiet. Typography pairs Inter Variable for everything functional with DM Mono for small all-caps labels and section eyebrows, which is a signature devtool move: mono labels say 'this is a product built by engineers' without resorting to skeuomorphism. Components are mostly flat and bordered rather than heavily shadowed, with a mix of 8px and 12px radii giving cards a modern-but-not-too-soft feel. The page alternates between generous white space sections and one dramatic dark band, creating rhythm without monotony.

## Tokens — Typography

### Inter Variable — Primary UI and heading typeface. Inter carries all functional text: body copy at 16px/400, nav at 14px/500, subheadings at 18–20px/600, and large display headlines at 48–60px/700. The custom font features (cv05, cv06, ss01) refine the alternate glyphs and tabular figures — a devtool-grade choice that signals engineering precision. Weight 700 is reserved for the hero headline; weight 500 dominates nav and buttons; weight 400 carries body copy. · `--font-inter-variable`

### DM Mono — Monospace label and eyebrow typeface. DM Mono appears in small all-caps section tags (e.g. 'WORKFLOW'), nav micro-labels, and technical micro-copy. Letter-spacing opens up to 0.05em–0.1em at smaller sizes, which is the mono-label signature: tight tracking would look cramped, the extra air gives labels a 'badge' presence. Custom features (ss03, ss04, ss05) activate stylistic alternates for the mono character set. · `--font-dm-mono`

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use #6a5ed9 exclusively for the primary CTA — never repurpose it for icons, headings, or decoration; its scarcity is what makes it feel like an action
- Use Inter Variable for all body, nav, button, and heading text; reserve DM Mono strictly for uppercase eyebrows, technical labels, and micro-copy
- Set buttons and cards to 12px radius; use 8px for inputs and nav items; use 9999px only for true pill tags and status badges
- Set hero headlines to 48–60px weight 700 in Zinc 900; center the headline, subtitle, and CTA vertically with generous 64–96px section gaps above and below
- Pair every section with a DM Mono uppercase eyebrow in a brand accent color (green, blue, or orange) — this is the signature move that signals devtool credibility
- Anchor light sections on #fafafa canvas with #ffffff card surfaces and #e4e4e7 hairline borders; do not introduce new background colors without a structural role
- Use the dark band (#18181b) sparingly — once per page — to make surrounding light sections feel brighter by contrast
- Reference exact token values (colors, radii, spacing) from this spec when generating new components; do not estimate or interpolate

### Don't
- Do not use #3f71d4, #db5434, #1bb152, or other brand accents as button fills — they are decorative, not action colors
- Do not apply heavy drop shadows to standard cards; use 1px borders and subtle 0 1px 3px shadows, reserving 0 25px 50px shadow for hero-level elevation only
- Do not mix Inter and DM Mono in the same sentence or label — DM Mono is for standalone labels and eyebrows only
- Do not center-align body copy or feature descriptions — keep body text left-aligned for readability, reserving center alignment for hero and section intros
- Do not introduce a new accent color outside the four-color brand palette (violet, blue, orange, green)
- Do not use #27272a for decorative text on light backgrounds where #71717a secondary text would suffice; reserve Zinc 800 for headings and primary copy
- Do not stack multiple colored gradients in the same view; one gradient or color-wash per section maximum
- Do not use border-radius above 12px for functional components (buttons, inputs, cards) — 16–24px should only appear on oversized feature cards or decorative frames

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 0 | Canvas | `#fafafa` | Page background, hero and feature sections |
| 1 | Card | `#ffffff` | Raised product cards, inner content blocks |
| 2 | Wash | `#f4f4f5` | Subtle alternating section background, footer strip |
| 3 | Dark Band | `#18181b` | Dark feature section (e.g. 'Built for developers') |
| 4 | Color Wash | `#dcfce7` | Decorative green section background for variety |

## Elevation

- **Card:** `0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1), 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`
- **Bordered card:** `0 0 0 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.05), 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)`
- **Elevated card / modal:** `0 25px 50px -12px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)`
- **Heavy-outlined card:** `0 0 0 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.75)`
- **Sticky nav:** `0 0 0 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.05), 0 20px 25px -5px rgba(0,0,0,0.1), 0 8px 10px -6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`

## Imagery

Product screenshots dominate the visual language: full macOS window captures with menu bars, code editors, and colorful gradient wallpapers (green-to-coral, violet-to-blue) serve as the primary 'hero images'. These are always contained within a rounded frame (8–12px radius), never full-bleed. Illustration style is minimal — small line-art character mascots (the cartoon gnome/bird figures flanking the Linux announcement pill) and simple folder/file-tree icons in the dark section. No lifestyle photography, no stock imagery. The dark 'Built for developers' section uses a subtle radial-line concentric-circle motif behind the UI card, giving depth without illustration. Icon style: thin-stroke outlined icons in brand accent colors (violet, blue, green), consistent 1.5–2px stroke weight. Imagery is decorative-atmosphere and product-showcase — it sells the product, not the brand.

## Layout

Max-width ~1200px centered content area with generous side padding. Hero is a centered vertical stack: nav bar → DM Mono eyebrow pill → large display headline → subtitle → single violet CTA → free-trial micro-copy → product screenshot frame. The page alternates between light and dark bands in a consistent rhythm: light hero → light product showcase → light trusted-by logo strip → dark 'Built for developers' feature band. Each band is separated by 64–96px vertical padding, with seamless flow (no dividers between bands). Feature sections inside the dark band use centered 2-column or 3-column card grids. The overall density is spacious and breathing — sections rarely compete for attention, and the single dark band creates a strong rhythm reset mid-page. Navigation is a clean top bar with logo left, links center, CTA right; sticky on scroll with a subtle border.

**3-5 Example Component Prompts**

1. *Create a hero section:* Background #fafafa. Centered DM Mono eyebrow pill in #1bb152 (13px, letter-spacing 0.1em, uppercase, 4px 12px padding, 9999px radius). Headline 'Headline here' at 48px Inter Variable weight 700, #27272a, line-height 1.14. Subtitle at 18px Inter weight 400, #71717a, max-width 640px. Violet CTA button (#6a5ed9 fill, white text, Inter 16px weight 500, 12px radius, 12px 24px padding). Section padding 96px top/bottom.

2. *Create a feature card:* White background, 1px #e4e4e7 border, 12px radius, 24px padding. Small brand-color icon (32px, #3f71d4 stroke). Heading 'Feature title' at 20px Inter weight 600, #27272a. Body copy at 16px Inter weight 400, #71717a, line-height 1.63.

3. *Create a dark feature band:* Background #18181b, 96px vertical padding. Centered DM Mono eyebrow in #4ade80 ('WORKFLOW', 13px, 0.1em letter-spacing, uppercase). Heading at 36px Inter weight 700, #ffffff. Content card with #27272a surface, 1px #3f3f46 border, 12px radius, containing a file-tree UI with folder icons in #3f71d4 and #1bb152.

4. *Create a trusted-by logo strip:* Background #fafafa. Centered DM Mono eyebrow 'TRUSTED BY THOUSANDS OF TEAMS' in #71717a (12px, 0.1em letter-spacing, uppercase, #1bb152 word). Below: single horizontal row of 5–6 grayscale partner logos spaced 64px apart, all desaturated to #71717a opacity.

5. *Create a product screenshot frame:* Rounded container at 12px radius with 0 25px 50px -12px rgba(0,0,0,0.25) shadow. Inside: a macOS window screenshot showing a code editor over a green-to-coral gradient wallpaper. Frame max-width 900px, centered, with 64px section padding above and below.

## Signature Choices

**Four-color accent palette, not one.** Most brands commit to a single accent color. Tuple uses four — violet, blue, orange, green — but enforces a strict rule: violet is action, the other three are decoration. This lets the CTA stay singular and urgent while giving illustrations, product chrome, and section eyebrows a playful multi-color personality.

**Mono eyebrows above every section.** A DM Mono uppercase label in a brand accent color sits above section headings throughout the site. This is the strongest 'devtool identity' signal: it borrows the terminal/CLI aesthetic without being a code block, and it creates consistent vertical rhythm across sections.

**Dark band as rhythm device.** Most of the page is light. One dark band appears mid-page (the 'Built for developers' section), creating a dramatic contrast reset that makes the surrounding light sections feel brighter. The dark band also hosts the most technical UI (file tree, folder icons), reinforcing the 'product for engineers' message.

**Zinc-based neutral scale.** Tuple avoids blue-tinted or warm-tinted grays — the neutrals are true zinc (cool but achromatic). This keeps the four accent colors visually pure; warm grays would muddy the coral and saffron, cool grays would fight the cobalt and iris.

## Similar Brands

- **Linear** — Same devtool sensibility — zinc neutrals, single accent color for CTAs, generous whitespace, mono labels for technical identity
- **Vercel** — Dark-band rhythm device, minimal bordered cards, 8–12px radius, Inter Variable as primary typeface with mono accents
- **GitLab** — Purple primary CTA on light surfaces, multi-color accent palette used as decoration, section-eyebrow pattern above headings
- **CodeSandbox** — Devtool brand that uses colorful gradient product screenshots as hero imagery, clean white canvas, confident single-color CTA
