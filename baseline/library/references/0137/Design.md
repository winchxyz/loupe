# Qatchup — Style Reference
> Ink on warm paper, whispered quietly.

**Theme:** light

Qatchup uses a near-achromatic canvas where the only color is emotional: a washed-out grid of gray ink on warm white, with the product almost entirely communicated through type, spacing, and a single handwritten accent. The system is defined by restraint — a custom display sans (Aspekta) set tight with negative tracking, pill-shaped controls, and cards that float on layered hairline shadows rather than colored surfaces. Structure is established by border weight and vertical rhythm, not fills or gradients. A single script typeface (Fasthand) appears sparingly as a human signature — the 'Listen!' above the hero, the 'Open Letter' kicker — creating emotional warmth against an otherwise architectural grid. Components are minimal and ghosted: dark pill buttons for primary action, light pill buttons for secondary, bordered cards for content blocks, and thin dividers carrying the layout's load. The colorful hand-drawn illustration is decorative atmosphere, not a UI token system — the interface itself stays quiet and monochrome.

## Tokens — Colors

| Name | Value | Token | Role |
|------|-------|-------|------|
| Charcoal | `#080808` | `--color-charcoal` | Primary headings, high-emphasis text — the deepest ink against the warm white canvas, anchoring headlines at maximum contrast |
| Graphite | `#222222` | `--color-graphite` | Body text, icon strokes, secondary headings — slightly lighter than Charcoal for body density where pure black feels too heavy |
| Mid Ink | `#292929` | `--color-mid-ink` | Filled button background, dark UI surfaces, strong border emphasis — the primary action surface; charcoal-darker than body text for weight contrast against pills |
| Steel | `#696969` | `--color-steel` | Default border color, card edges, icon strokes at rest — the structural hairline that carries the entire layout; appears in 260 borderColor uses, making it the most-used stroke in the system |
| Fog | `#999999` | `--color-fog` | Muted secondary borders, low-emphasis dividers — a lighter hairline for de-emphasized structure |
| Ash | `#b2b2b2` | `--color-ash` | Card inner borders, subtle dividers inside containers — softer than Steel for nested elements |
| Slate | `#8d8d8d` | `--color-slate` | Disabled or inactive border state, decorative dividers — sits between Steel and Fog for tertiary structural lines |
| Mist | `#cccccc` | `--color-mist` | Subtle shadow contribution, light card shadow base — a desaturated mid-gray for soft elevation |
| Silk | `#e4e4e7` | `--color-silk` | Image borders, body content dividers, light surface separators — the lightest visible structural line, near-white with just enough definition |
| Bone | `#fafafa` | `--color-bone` | Page canvas, card surfaces, link border, light text on dark — the warm white foundation; every other neutral reads against this base |
| Cream | `#f4f4f5` | `--color-cream` | Secondary button fill, elevated surface tone, subtle hover state — one step warmer/lighter than Bone for nested surfaces |

## Components

### Dark Pill Button
**Role:** Primary action control

Filled dark button at #292929 background, #fafafa text, Aspekta 500 at 16px. Radius 100px creates the pill shape. Padding 11px vertical, 22px horizontal. Used for the main 'Login / Sign up' action and any single primary CTA per screen. No visible border — the dark fill IS the boundary.

### Light Pill Button
**Role:** Secondary action control

Ghost button at #f4f4f5 background with #292929 text. Radius 100px. Same dimensions as the dark pill. Used when a secondary action sits next to a primary one without competing for weight.

### Floating Content Card
**Role:** Content panel — feedback widget, feature block

White surface (#fafafa) with 32px radius. Layered shadow: hairline ring (rgba(19,19,22,0.05) 0px 0px 0px 1px) + soft drop (rgba(0,0,0,0.04) 0px 2px 3px 0px, rgba(34,42,53,0.04) 0px 4px 6px 0px, rgba(0,0,0,0.05) 0px 1px 1px 0px). Padding 24-32px. Contains structured lists with icon + title + description rows separated by 16-24px gaps.

### Modal/Card with Deep Elevation
**Role:** Elevated overlay or popover

Same 32px radius and #fafafa surface, but with stronger shadow: adds rgba(47,48,55,0.05) 0px 24px 68px 0px to the standard card shadow stack. Used for elements that need to feel detached from the page surface.

### Rounded Image Frame
**Role:** Image container

16px radius border with subtle drop shadow (rgba(16,24,40,0.08) 0px 17px 23px -6px, rgba(16,24,40,0.03) 0px 6px 9px -3px). Used for product screenshots, portraits, and editorial images that need to feel lifted from the page.

### Navigation Bar
**Role:** Top-level page navigation

Full-width bar on Bone (#fafafa) background. Three-zone layout: brand mark left ('QP' wordmark), centered logo (the 'Q.' glyph), utility links right ('Blog' text link + dark pill button). No visible border or background fill — sits on the page canvas. Height ~60px.

### Centered Hero Block
**Role:** First-screen hero pattern

Vertically stacked, horizontally centered. Fasthand 32px accent line at #696969, then Aspekta 48-56px display headline at #080808 in 2 lines, then 16-18px body subtext at #696969. No background, no border — pure type on canvas. Generous vertical padding (80-120px top/bottom).

### Two-Column Letter Layout
**Role:** Long-form narrative sections

Left column: Fasthand kicker + Aspekta heading-lg subhead, max-width ~40% of container. Right column: body text at 18px weight 400, #696969, line-height 1.56. Columns separated by 40-60px gap. The asymmetric split creates editorial rhythm.

### Feedback Option Row
**Role:** Selectable item in the feedback widget

Horizontal row: icon (24px, #292929 stroke) + title (16px Aspekta 500, #080808) + description (14px Aspekta 400, #696969). Padding 12px vertical. Separated from neighbors by subtle background change or 8px gap, not a visible divider line.

### Grid Background Pattern
**Role:** Subtle page texture

Very faint square grid (1px lines at #e4e4e7 or similar low-contrast) behind the hero section. Not a component but a visual foundation — gives the flat canvas a sense of structure and technical precision.

### Wordmark Lockup
**Role:** Brand identity in header/footer

Small uppercase 'QP' set in Aspekta 500 at 14px, or the standalone 'Q.' glyph at 24px with the period as a design detail. Charcoal (#080808) on the light canvas. No logo color — identity is purely typographic.

### Illustrative Crowd Border
**Role:** Decorative full-bleed illustration

Hand-drawn doodle characters in a rainbow spectrum (blue, yellow, pink, orange, green) forming a crowd border at the bottom of the hero. Full-bleed width, organic edge (not clipped to a rectangle). This is the ONLY color in the system — purely decorative, never applied to UI controls or text.

### Text Link
**Role:** Inline navigation link

Aspekta 400 at 16px, #292929, no underline by default. Appears in nav and body copy. 28 borderColor uses of #fafafa suggest links may have a subtle background or underline treatment in certain states.

### Hairline Divider
**Role:** Section separator within cards or lists

1px line at #e4e4e7 (Silk) or #b2b2b2 (Ash). No vertical padding — just a thin horizontal rule. Used between content rows inside the feedback widget card.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use 100px or 999px radius for all interactive elements — pill buttons and fully rounded tags only
- Set Aspekta at 48-56px with -0.030em to -0.035em letter-spacing for all display headlines
- Use #696969 (Steel) as the default border color for cards, dividers, and structural lines
- Layer shadows with a hairline ring (0px 0px 0px 1px) first, then soft drop shadows — never use a single hard shadow
- Reserve Fasthand for at most one emotional kicker per section — the 'Listen!' or 'Open Letter' moment
- Keep all UI elements in the neutral palette; color appears only in decorative illustration
- Maintain 80-120px vertical rhythm between sections — the whitespace is part of the brand

### Don't
- Don't introduce a chromatic accent color for buttons, links, or text — the system has none
- Don't use square or 4-8px radius on cards — the 32px radius is structural to the brand
- Don't apply the decorative rainbow illustration style to icons, controls, or functional graphics
- Don't use Aspekta weight 500 for body text — reserve it for button labels and single-word emphasis
- Don't add background colors to sections — the system relies on whitespace and the warm-white canvas for separation
- Don't use gradients on UI elements — the system is flat and matte, elevation comes from shadow only
- Don't set letter-spacing to 0 or positive values on display sizes — the tight tracking is signature

## Surfaces

|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 0 | Page Canvas | `#fafafa` | The base warm-white background of all pages |
| 1 | Card Surface | `#fafafa` | Floating content panels and cards — same color as canvas, distinguished only by shadow and radius |
| 2 | Secondary Surface | `#f4f4f5` | Nested or secondary buttons, subtle hover states, elevated sub-panels |
| 3 | Dark Surface | `#292929` | Primary action button fill, dark UI elements requiring maximum contrast against the light canvas |

## Imagery

Imagery is bimodal: product/UI screenshots sit in 16px-radius frames with soft directional shadows, while decorative editorial illustration appears as a full-bleed crowd of hand-drawn doodle characters in rainbow colors. The illustration is organic, uncontained, and runs edge-to-edge at the base of sections — it bleeds without a frame or mask. Photography (if any) would be high-key and desaturated to match the neutral palette. Icons are 24px outlined strokes in #292929, thin weight, monoline. The system treats illustration as atmosphere, not content — it's the only place color is permitted, and it stays in a contained decorative band rather than leaking into UI controls.

## Layout

Page model is max-width 1200px centered with generous outer padding (40-60px). The hero is a centered single-column type stack on the canvas — no split image+text, no full-bleed background. Sections below transition to a two-column asymmetric layout: left column is narrow (~40%) for heading + kicker, right column is wider for body copy, with 40-60px gap. The feedback widget card breaks the pattern — it appears as a floating centered card overlapping the decorative illustration band, creating a layered focal point. Navigation is a minimal top bar with three zones (brand left, logo center, actions right), no sticky behavior visible. The page breathes: 80-120px between sections, no dense grids, no card grids. The rhythm is editorial — one idea per section, each given room to exist. The faint background grid pattern behind the hero adds technical texture without competing with content.

## Agent Prompt Guide

**Quick Color Reference**
- text (primary): #080808
- text (body): #222222
- text (muted): #696969
- background: #fafafa
- border: #696969
- primary action: #292929 (filled action)

**Example Component Prompts**
1. Create a primary CTA button: 100px border-radius, #292929 background, #fafafa text, Aspekta weight 500 at 16px, padding 11px vertical / 22px horizontal. No border.

2. Create a content card: #fafafa background, 32px border-radius, padding 28px, shadow stack of hairline ring + soft multi-layer drop (rgba(19,19,22,0.05) 0px 0px 0px 1px + rgba(0,0,0,0.04) 0px 2px 3px 0px + rgba(34,42,53,0.04) 0px 4px 6px 0px). No visible border — shadow defines the edge.

3. Create a hero headline: centered on #fafafa canvas. Fasthand accent at 32px in #696969 ('Listen!'). Then Aspekta 400 at 48px, #080808, letter-spacing -1.44px, 2 lines. Body subtext at 16px Aspekta 400, #696969, max-width 480px centered.

4. Create a two-column letter section: left column at 40% width with Aspekta 40px heading at #080808 (letter-spacing -0.8px). Right column at 55% width with Aspekta 18px body at #696969, line-height 1.56. 48px gap between columns.

5. Create a feedback option row: 24px icon (outlined, #292929 stroke) + Aspekta 500 at 16px title (#080808) + Aspekta 400 at 14px description (#696969). Horizontal layout, 12px padding vertical, 16px gap between icon and text.

## Signature Design Choices

Three choices define this system's character:

1. **Negative letter-spacing as brand voice.** Aspekta's tracking at -0.035em for 56px text pulls characters into unified blocks. Most interfaces use 0 or positive tracking at display sizes; this system inverts that, creating a condensed, confident, almost architectural headline style where words feel constructed rather than spoken.

2. **Shadow-only card definition.** Cards share the exact same #fafafa color as the page canvas. They exist only because of a layered shadow that starts with a hairline ring (0px 0px 0px 1px at 5% opacity) and builds into soft multi-direction drops. Removing the shadow would make cards invisible — the elevation system IS the surface system.

3. **One script typeface in a sea of geometric sans.** Fasthand appears at most 1-2 times per page — the 'Listen!' above the hero, the 'Open Letter' kicker. It creates emotional punctuation against the clinical Aspekta. This restraint is critical: if the script were used throughout, the system would feel inconsistent. Its scarcity makes each appearance land.
