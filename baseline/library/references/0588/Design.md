# Warp — Style Reference
> Deep-space command shell — a frosted obsidian cockpit where every pixel earns its place and color is a rare, meaningful signal.

**Theme:** dark

Warp operates in a deep charcoal universe: near-black canvas (#121212) layered with subtly lighter surfaces (#1e1e1d, #353534) and no shadows — elevation is communicated entirely through background-color steps. The primary typeface, Matter, does all the expressive heavy lifting: tight negative tracking at display sizes (-0.04em at 56-64px) whispers confidence rather than shouting, and the custom OpenType features (cv03, cv04, cv09, cv11) give it a precision-engineered feel that generic sans-serifs lack. Color is almost entirely absent — the one chromatic exception, a muted sage-green (#799c92), surfaces exclusively as an accent on section subheadings, making it feel like a terminal prompt color that escaped into the UI. The terminal product screenshot is the hero; the interface reproduces itself as marketing material, blurring the line between product and page.

## Components

### Primary Download Button
**Role:** Highest-priority CTA — download action

Background #ffffff, text #121212 (or near-black), border-radius 6px, padding 12px 20px. Matter weight 600 at 16px. Appears in the nav and hero. The white fill on a near-black page makes this the only high-contrast interactive element visible at a glance.

### Dark Filled Button
**Role:** Secondary actions within dark UI panels

Background #2f2f2f, text #faf9f6, no visible border, border-radius 4px, padding 8px 12px. Matter weight 400 at 14px. Used inside the terminal product UI for sub-actions. Subtle box-shadow: rgba(18,18,18,0.2) 0 0 16px.

### Ghost Surface Button
**Role:** Tertiary actions on dark backgrounds

Background rgba(255,255,255,0.04), effectively invisible fill, border-radius 4px, padding 8px 12px. Text #faf9f6. Used for low-emphasis actions that need click target area without visual weight.

### Pill Icon Button
**Role:** Toggle or mode-switch controls

Background #353534, text/icon #afaeac, border-radius 50px, padding 10px. Circular or tight-aspect buttons for UI chrome controls like view toggles. Monochrome icon at reduced brightness.

### Code Snippet Block
**Role:** Inline command display in hero

Background #353534, text #e3e2e0, font Geist Mono 400 16px, border-radius 10px, padding 12px 16px. Displays 'brew install --cask warp' as a copyable command. Icon button for copy action at trailing edge.

### Primary Feature Card
**Role:** Main content cards throughout feature sections

Background #121212, border-radius 16px, no border, no shadow, padding 0 (content inside handles its own padding). Used in 12+ instances. Content bleeds to card edges — imagery is contained by the radius, not inset padding.

### Elevated Content Card
**Role:** Secondary raised container within a section

Background #353534, border-radius 20px, no shadow, no border. One step above the canvas in the surface stack — used for dropdown/panel containers in the product screenshot.

### Padded Inner Card
**Role:** Text-content sub-container

Background #1e1e1d, border-radius 10px, padding 16px on all sides. Used for structured text blocks like 'Problem Statement' panels within the product screenshot interface.

### Announcement Bar
**Role:** Top-of-page notification strip

Background #090909 (near pure black), text #e3e2e0 at 14px Matter weight 400, link in #faf9f6 with underline. Full-width, 40px height. The single horizontal line of text and link creates minimum footprint.

### Navigation Bar
**Role:** Primary site navigation

Background #ffffff (scrolled) or transparent, height ~48px. Logo left, nav links center in Matter Medium 16px color #868684, CTA buttons right. Nav links use 'Book a demo' as ghost text and 'Download for Mac' as the white-fill primary. backdrop-filter: blur(20px) on scroll.

### Section Eyebrow Label
**Role:** Feature section category marker

Text #799c92, Matter weight 400, 14-16px, letter-spacing 0.1em (wide-tracked). Placed above section headings. The only chromatic color in the system — acts like a terminal prompt cursor bleeding into copy.

### Trust Logo Bar
**Role:** Social proof logos row

Background #121212 (canvas), logos in #868684 to #afaeac (desaturated, low-contrast fills). Full-width horizontal flex, logos centered, no borders or dividers. Density: compact, 12-16px gap between logos.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use #121212 as the default page canvas — every section that lacks a specific override inherits this base.
- Apply Terminal Sage (#799c92) only to eyebrow/subheading text above section titles — never as a button color, background, or decoration.
- Set display headings (48px+) in Matter weight 400 with letter-spacing -0.03em to -0.04em — the negative tracking at these sizes is mandatory, not optional.
- Step surfaces upward using background color only: #121212 → #1e1e1d → #353534. Never use borders or shadows to separate co-planar sections.
- Use border-radius 16px for all feature cards, 4px for all rectangular buttons, and 50px for pill/circular controls — these three radii cover 90% of UI components.
- Render all terminal commands and code samples in Geist Mono 400 16px on #353534 backgrounds with #e3e2e0 text.
- Keep the white (#ffffff) download button exclusive to primary navigation CTAs — it is the sole maximum-contrast element and dilutes if reused.

### Don't
- Never introduce additional chromatic colors beyond Terminal Sage (#799c92) — the system is intentionally near-monochrome and a second hue breaks the terminal-inspired restraint.
- Do not use box shadows or drop shadows on cards or sections — depth is communicated through surface color steps, not elevation effects.
- Avoid font weights above 600 for Matter — the type system lives in the 400-600 range; heavier weights create visual noise against the dark canvas.
- Do not use border-radius above 20px on cards and never apply round corners (50px+) to rectangular content containers — pill radius is reserved for icon-button controls only.
- Never place light (#faf9f6 or #ffffff) backgrounds behind full sections as a design choice — light backgrounds appear only on the nav bar on scroll and the primary download button fill.
- Do not add decorative gradients, glows, or colored backgrounds to content sections — the aurora photography in the hero is the only atmospheric color; UI components stay achromatic.
- Avoid setting body or paragraph text above 18px — Matter at 16px is the comfortable reading size; larger body text breaks the dense, information-forward density of the layout.

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 0 | Deep Base | `#090909` | Absolute floor — nav overlay backgrounds, announcement bar |
| 1 | Canvas | `#121212` | Primary page background used across most sections |
| 2 | Elevated Card | `#1e1e1d` | Footer background, slightly raised content regions |
| 3 | Raised Surface | `#353534` | Card backgrounds, pill button fills, dropdown containers |
| 4 | Interactive Surface | `#40403f` | Hover states, focused overlay containers |

## Imagery

Warp uses a tight blend of product screenshots and atmospheric photography. The hero features a full-bleed dark background with aurora-borealis-style photography (deep teals, greens, reds against black sky) serving as environmental mood — not literal content. The product terminal window is the true hero object, rendered as a realistic macOS chrome screenshot with traffic-light controls, tab bars, and actual UI state. This blurs the boundary between marketing and product: the interface is the hero. Below the fold, product screenshots are contained within dark rounded-corner cards (16px radius) and shown at slight angles or as cropped panels. Video thumbnails appear with a centered play button overlay on a dark gradient mask. No lifestyle photography, no abstract illustration — either real product UI or atmospheric dark landscapes. Icons are minimal, outlined at ~16-20px, monochrome (#868684), single-weight stroke style. Integration partner logos (Docker, GitHub, Asana, etc.) are desaturated to Ash Text (#868684) tone.

## Layout

Max-width ~1200px centered, but hero sections are full-bleed dark. The first screen is a full-viewport dark hero with centered headline stack, a two-button CTA row (white filled + code snippet block side by side), and a product screenshot below the fold edge. Sections alternate between full-bleed #121212 canvas regions and slightly differentiated #1e1e1d footer zones — no alternating light/dark bands. Content arrangement is primarily centered stacks for headline+body+CTA groups, switching to asymmetric text-left / product-right two-column layouts for feature sections (55/45 split). Feature detail sections use a left-side numbered list with a right-side product screenshot panel. Section vertical rhythm uses ~80px gaps. The navigation is a fixed top bar ~48px tall with logo, center nav links, and right-side dual CTA buttons. A full-width announcement bar sits above the nav, adding ~32px to the top chrome.

4. **Pill Control Button**: Background #353534, icon/text #afaeac, border-radius 50px, padding 10px. No border. Used for view-toggle or mode-switch controls in terminal chrome.

5. **Trust Logo Bar**: Background #121212, full-width flex row, logos rendered in #868684 fill. Text label above: 'Trusted by over 700,000 developers' at 14px Matter 400 #868684, centered. Logo row gap 24px, no borders.

## Motion System

Transitions run at 0.4s for state changes (color, opacity) using cubic-bezier(0.44, 0, 0.56, 1) — a slightly decelerating ease-in-out that feels mechanical rather than bouncy. Quick microinteractions (hover color changes on links) use 0.15s ease. The 0.4s duration is unusually long for hover states, giving interactions a deliberate, weighty quality consistent with a terminal application's cadence. Transition only color, opacity, text-decoration-color, and text-underline-offset — never transform or scale on hover for navigation elements.
