# Craft — Style Reference
> botanical conservatory on warm parchment — cream pages holding vivid green specimens and one quiet forest room.

**Theme:** light

Craft operates as a botanical conservatory on warm parchment: a cream canvas (#f7f5f2) carries the whole body, punctuated by a single deep-forest hero (#1d3023) that swallows the viewport behind a flowing organic green shape. Type is the primary voice — a custom condensed serif at 180px whispers the brand promise in tight -0.03em tracking, then a lighter Arizona Flare handles everything else at human scale. Color is used as punctuation, not decoration: the cream surface dominates, a near-black plum-brown carries all text, and a vivid lime green (#26d862) appears only on action, inline links, and the occasional accent word inside headlines. Components stay flat and unshadowed — the hierarchy comes from type size, generous whitespace (56px section gaps), and 8px-radius cards that hold full-bleed flower photography. The rhythm is editorial: one dramatic dark hero, then a stream of quiet cream sections with centered serif statements, 4-column stat strips, and image grids that let the botanical subjects do the work.

## Tokens — Colors

| Name | Value | Token | Role |
|------|-------|-------|------|
| Bone Linen | `#f7f5f2` | `--color-bone-linen` | Page canvas, body backgrounds — the warm off-white that carries almost every section and makes the dark hero and green accents feel like specimens on display |
| Oat Milk | `#eae6df` | `--color-oat-milk` | Card surfaces, elevated panels, secondary containers — a half-step darker than the canvas for gentle separation without shadow |
| Driftwood | `#d7d2cc` | `--color-driftwood` | Hairline borders, dividers, structural separators — warm gray that reads as line work, not as color |
| Ash Mauve | `#645757` | `--color-ash-mauve` | Secondary text, captions, muted labels — used where near-black would be too heavy, sits at 80 instances |
| Mahogany Hush | `#504344` | `--color-mahogany-hush` | Dark accent for small headings and emphasis — warmer alternative to the primary text color when a touch of depth is needed |
| Obsidian Plum | `#2a1a1d` | `--color-obsidian-plum` | Primary text, body copy, all headings, nav links — a near-black with warm plum undertone that pairs with the cream canvas at 15.3:1 contrast |
| Forest Depths | `#1d3023` | `--color-forest-depths` | Hero section background, dark surface, outlined ghost-button borders — the deep green room that introduces the brand and reappears as a dark contrast panel |
| Lime Pulse | `#26d862` | `--color-lime-pulse` | Primary action buttons, inline links, accent words inside headlines, active nav states — vivid green used sparingly as functional punctuation, never as decoration |
| Peacock Teal | `#0e634f` | `--color-peacock-teal` | Stat numbers, data emphasis — a deeper teal that shares hue with the forest hero but reads quieter so it can carry numerical data in stat cards |

## Components

### Floating Pill Navigation
**Role:** Primary site navigation, sticky at top center

A pill-shaped container with 4px radius holding 'Hire' and 'Move' text tabs, the 'Craft' wordmark in Arizona Flare Condensed at ~20px, and a square menu toggle with 3-dot icon. Background: #f7f5f2 matching the canvas. Text: #1d3023 for tabs, #2a1a1d for wordmark. Hairline 1px top border or subtle shadow for separation. The pill floats centered, not full-width, with ~8px vertical padding and 24px horizontal padding.

### Filled Primary Button
**Role:** Primary call-to-action — form submits, key conversions

Background: #26d862 (Lime Pulse). Text: #2a1a1d at 15–16px Arizona Flare weight 400. Padding: 8px 16px to 12px 24px. Radius: 8px. No shadow. The vivid green against the cream canvas is the highest-contrast action in the system — it should appear once per view maximum.

### Ghost Outlined Button
**Role:** Secondary actions, less important links

Transparent background. Border: 1px #2a1a1d or #1d3023. Text: matching border color at 15–16px. Padding: 8px 16px. Radius: 8px. Used when a filled green button would compete with the primary action or when the button sits on the dark hero.

### Hero Section
**Role:** Full-viewport opening statement

Background: #1d3023 (Forest Depths) full-bleed. A flowing organic green shape (abstract 3D or CSS shape, vivid green tones) sits behind the text as atmospheric decoration. Headline: Arizona Flare Condensed weight 300 at 180px, color #f7f5f2 (Bone Linen), line-height 0.85, letter-spacing -5.4px. The second line of the headline appears in a slightly different weight/style for rhythmic contrast. Supporting paragraph: Arizona Flare at 18px, #eae6df, max-width ~420px. The hero occupies the full first viewport with generous side padding.

### Centered Section Statement
**Role:** Mission/positioning text block in light sections

Centered text on #f7f5f2 canvas. Headline: Arizona Flare Condensed at 48px, weight 400, color #2a1a1d, line-height 0.95. Key phrases within the headline switch to #26d862 green as accent words (e.g., 'brands and agencies', 'design community'). Body paragraph below at 16px, #645757. Max-width: ~800px, centered.

### Stat Card
**Role:** 4-column data display strip

Flat card on #eae6df (Oat Milk) surface with 8px radius. Large number: Arizona Flare Condensed at 48px, weight 400, color #0e634f (Peacock Teal) or #1d3023. Label/description below: Arizona Flare at 13–15px, #645757, line-height 1.50. Padding: 24px. No shadow — separation comes from the half-step surface color difference. Four cards in a row with 16px gaps.

### Flower Image Card
**Role:** Full-bleed photography in content grids

Image fills the card edge-to-edge with 8px radius clipping. No padding, no text overlay. Images are close-up botanical subjects (flowers, plants) with vivid natural colors — yellow, pink, purple, green. Each card is 1 of 4 in a row at equal width. Gap between cards: 16px. The image does all the work; no caption, no overlay.

### Section Label
**Role:** Small uppercase or letter-spaced label above section content

Arizona Flare at 12–13px, weight 400, color #645757, letter-spacing normal or slight positive. Appears as a quiet kicker above section headlines (e.g., 'CRAFT AT A GLANCE', 'WAYS WE SUPPORT YOUR GROWTH'). All caps or sentence case with a period.

### Inline Green Link
**Role:** Highlighted text within paragraphs and headlines

Same surrounding text size, but color #26d862. No underline by default. Used to make specific phrases stand out within a block of dark text — the green reads as 'this is what makes us different' without disrupting flow.

### Body Paragraph
**Role:** Long-form descriptive text

Arizona Flare Variable weight 400 at 16px, line-height 1.50, color #2a1a1d. Max-width: 720px for readability. No first-line indent, generous bottom margin (24–32px) between paragraphs.

### Menu Toggle
**Role:** Hamburger/menu open trigger in nav

Square button, ~40×40px, 4px radius. Border: 1px #1d3023 or #eae6df depending on nav context. Icon: 3 horizontal dots or lines in #1d3023. Sits at the right end of the floating pill nav.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use the 180px condensed serif only for the hero statement — it's the loudest voice in the system and should appear once per page
- Apply #26d862 (Lime Pulse) filled buttons sparingly — one primary action per viewport, never stack two green buttons side by side
- Set letter-spacing explicitly: -5.4px at 180px, -3.12px at 104px, -0.48px at 32px, scaling proportionally through the type ramp
- Use the surface color difference (#f7f5f2 → #eae6df) for card separation instead of box-shadows — the system is intentionally flat
- Let full-bleed flower imagery sit edge-to-edge in 8px-radius cards with no captions — the image is the content
- Anchor any dark moment to the Forest Depths #1d3023 — never use pure black, the warm green undertone is what makes it feel like a room rather than a void
- Pick one weight tier per size: weight 300 for 104–180px display, weight 400 for 20–48px mid-headlines, weight 350 only at 32px subheadings, weight 400 everywhere else

### Don't
- Don't introduce a new font family — the system runs on exactly two custom serifs (Arizona Flare and Arizona Flare Condensed) and the contrast between them is the signature
- Don't use Lime Pulse #26d862 for body text, borders, or decorative fills — it is exclusively an action and link color
- Don't apply box-shadows to cards or buttons — separation comes from the two-tone cream surface and 8px radius
- Don't mix line-height styles within a size — 0.85 for display (48px+), 1.08 for subheadings (20–32px), 1.18–1.50 for body (12–18px)
- Don't center-align body paragraphs longer than 2 lines — left-align at max-width 720px for readability
- Don't use the Peaacock Teal #0e634f outside of numerical data contexts — it is reserved for stat numbers and data emphasis
- Don't place colored text on the dark Forest Depths hero unless it's Bone Linen #f7f5f2 — the contrast math is tuned for cream-on-forest, not green-on-forest

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Page Canvas | `#f7f5f2` | Default body background for all content sections |
| 2 | Card Surface | `#eae6df` | Elevated cards, stat tiles, contained content blocks |
| 3 | Hero / Dark Section | `#1d3023` | Full-bleed dark sections — hero, feature moments, footer |
| 4 | Highlight Surface | `#26d862` | Filled action buttons and occasional green wash highlights |

## Imagery

Imagery is botanical and close-cropped: flowers in full bloom, shot tight enough to fill the frame, treated with a soft slightly-saturated palette — vivid yellows, pinks, purples, and greens. The hero uses an abstract organic green shape (3D-rendered or fluid CSS/SVG) rather than photography: it flows like draped fabric or a leaf, in lime-to-forest gradient tones, with soft volumetric lighting. The image cards are full-bleed, edge-to-edge, clipped only by the 8px card radius — no padding, no overlays, no text. The overall effect is greenhouse/conservatory: each specimen is isolated on a cream wall and lit like it's on display. No people, no lifestyle photography, no stock imagery. Icons are minimal — line-based, 1px stroke, monochrome. No illustrations or decorative graphics beyond the hero shape.

## Layout

The page model is max-width contained (~1200px) with generous side margins (~77px). The hero is the only full-bleed section, breaking out edge-to-edge in Forest Depths. Below the hero, everything sits on the cream canvas in a centered single-column flow: centered headline blocks, then 4-column stat grids, then 4-column image grids, separated by 56–64px section gaps. Navigation is a floating centered pill that sits over the hero (not a full-width bar). The first content section is a centered text statement at max-width ~800px. Stats appear in a 4-up card row. Image cards appear in a 4-up row, full-bleed. Section rhythm is consistent vertical spacing with no alternating background colors — the dark hero is the only departure from cream. Content alternates between centered text stacks and 4-column grids, never two-column split layouts. The overall feel is editorial: one dramatic moment, then a calm, spacious stream of specimens and statements.

## Gradient System

Gradients are not used as a token system — the design relies on flat surfaces and a single two-tone cream stack. The only gradient-adjacent element is the abstract green organic shape in the hero, which is a 3D/fluid visual element (lime-to-forest green tones) rather than a reusable CSS gradient token. Do not introduce linear or radial gradients for buttons, cards, or backgrounds.

## Elevation Philosophy

The system is intentionally shadowless. Separation between elements is achieved entirely through two mechanisms: (1) the two-tone cream surface stack (#f7f5f2 canvas → #eae6df cards) provides quiet depth without shadow, and (2) 8px border-radius on all containers softens the edges just enough to feel handmade. Adding box-shadows would break the editorial, flat-lay greenhouse feel. Borders use 1px #d7d2cc (Driftwood) only where structural division is needed.

## Similar Brands

- **Locomotive** — Same warm cream canvas, condensed serif display type at hero scale, and botanical/organic imagery treated as specimens on a quiet page
- **Pentagram** — Shared editorial rhythm — one dramatic typographic moment per section, centered statements, generous whitespace, serif type doing the heavy lifting
- **Studio Daïdai** — Same flat two-tone surface approach without shadows, cream backgrounds, and vivid green used as functional punctuation rather than decoration
- **Resn** — Both pair dark immersive hero moments with light editorial body sections and use a single accent color for emphasis rather than a full palette
- **Instrument** — Similar creative-agency structure — full-bleed dark hero, centered pill nav, cream body sections with stat strips, and photography that fills cards edge-to-edge
