# Palette Supply — Style Reference
> art-supply shelf in a sunlit studio

**Theme:** light

Palette Supply operates on the principle that color IS the product — the interface recedes so that swatches can speak. A warm cream canvas (#f2f0e9) acts like a designer's worktable, with matte rectangular swatches scattered at varying sizes and aspect ratios, each one a distinct earthy hue from a curated palette. The UI chrome is deliberately quiet: a deep ink black (#141212) for text, a single saturated blue-violet (#3051a8) reserved exclusively for actions and links, and zero shadows — every boundary is a hairline border or a color edge. Typography is custom and confident: 'esbuild' stamps oversized 64px display titles with extremely tight tracking, while 'ppsupply' handles everything else at whisper-light weights (100 and 300) that make the page feel airy and unhurried. The result reads less like a web app and more like a well-organized stationery catalog — generous whitespace, tactile surfaces, no gradients, no glassmorphism, no decorative noise.

## Tokens — Colors

| Name | Value | Token | Role |
|------|-------|-------|------|
| Studio Cream | `#f2f0e9` | `--color-studio-cream` | Page canvas — warm off-white ground that warms every color placed on it, the single largest surface in the system |
| Paper White | `#ffffff` | `--color-paper-white` | Elevated card and surface layer, used when a swatch or content block needs to sit above the canvas |
| Ink Black | `#141212` | `--color-ink-black` | Primary text, heading strokes, and hairline borders — slightly warmer than pure black, pairs cleanly with the cream canvas |
| Pencil Gray | `#a1a0a0` | `--color-pencil-gray` | Muted secondary text and inactive borders, the only mid-gray in the neutral scale |
| Sage Wash | `#dde5d8` | `--color-sage-wash` | Soft tinted surface for tags, list rows, and secondary buttons — a barely-green neutral that adds warmth without committing to color |
| Studio Ivory | `#d7d7c8` | `--color-studio-ivory` | Swatch surface — the neutral anchor card color used to display palette sets; warm, slightly green-tinged, reads as unpainted canvas |
| Cobalt Command | `#3051a8` | `--color-cobalt-command` | Primary action fill, active link color, and icon accents — the only saturated chromatic in the UI, used sparingly to make clicks feel decisive |
| Forest Ink | `#3f593d` | `--color-forest-ink` | Dark accent for premium swatches and select button variants — muted, almost black, recedes like aged leather |
| Marigold | `#f89c35` | `--color-marigold` | Warm chromatic swatch accent — vivid orange that pops against the cream canvas, used as a featured palette member |
| Buttercup | `#f6dc2e` | `--color-buttercup` | Bright chromatic swatch — primary yellow, the most luminous accent in the palette set, draws the eye like a highlighter |
| Cobalt Pop | `#0159bd` | `--color-cobalt-pop` | Secondary blue swatch — brighter and more cyan than Cobalt Command, used as a palette swatch rather than UI action |
| Terracotta | `#863a29` | `--color-terracotta` | Earth-red swatch accent — the deep burnt-orange that grounds warm palettes |
| Rose Clay | `#ed93af` | `--color-rose-clay` | Soft pink swatch — dusty rose that reads as warm, not saccharine |
| Rust | `#a0674f` | `--color-rust` | Warm brown swatch — mid-tone earthy orange, a bridge between terracotta and tan |
| Wheat | `#b99572` | `--color-wheat` | Muted tan swatch — soft warm neutral that sits between cream and brown |
| Saffron | `#d8c660` | `--color-saffron` | Olive-yellow swatch — slightly green-shifted yellow, more sophisticated than pure butter |
| Olive Stone | `#a9ab72` | `--color-olive-stone` | Muted yellow-green swatch — the sage-olive that ties natural palettes together |
| Linen Blush | `#dcc5bd` | `--color-linen-blush` | Soft pink-beige swatch — the lightest warm neutral in the chromatic range, like raw silk |
| Stone | `#c7b8ab` | `--color-stone` | Warm gray swatch — taupe with pink undertones, the bridge between cream and brown |

## Components

### Color Swatch Card
**Role:** The primary product display — rectangular color samples shown at varying sizes and aspect ratios across the canvas

Flat rectangle with no border, no shadow, no padding. Background is a single solid color from the palette (e.g. #3f593d, #d7d7c8, #c7b8ab). Border-radius is 12px. Sizes vary deliberately — some are tall narrow strips, some are wide short bands, some are small squares — creating a scattered gallery layout rather than a uniform grid. No text overlay on the swatch itself; metadata sits adjacent.

### Rectangular Button
**Role:** Primary action control — used for 'Add to cart', 'Subscribe', and similar functional triggers

5px border-radius, 14px vertical padding × 30px horizontal padding. Fill is Cobalt Command (#3051a8) with white text at 15px ppsupply weight 300. Border 1px solid Ink Black (#141212) wraps all buttons — even filled ones — creating a printed-sticker feel. No hover state with shadow; hover shifts fill slightly or inverts to white-fill + ink text.

### Pill Button
**Role:** Secondary action, tag toggle, or filter chip

100px border-radius (full pill). 8px vertical padding × 20px horizontal padding. Fill is white or Sage Wash (#dde5d8). Text is ppsupply weight 300 at 15px in Ink Black. 1px Ink Black border. Compact, tactile, button-like — used for 'All', 'Warm', 'Cool' filter tags and similar.

### Ghost Text Link
**Role:** Inline navigation and editorial links within body copy

No background, no border, no underline by default. Text color is Cobalt Command (#3051a8) at ppsupply weight 400, 15-16px. On hover, underline appears with 1px offset. Links feel inline and continuous with body text rather than chunky click targets.

### Discount Badge
**Role:** Floating promotional indicator — anchored to a corner of the canvas or card

Circular 1000px-radius badge (appears as a perfect circle ~40-48px diameter). Fill is Cobalt Command (#3051a8). Text is white ppsupply weight 300 at 12px, centered, two lines ('35%' / 'OFF'). No border, no shadow. Functions as a persistent floating element on the page corner.

### Input Field
**Role:** Text input for email capture, search, and form fields

100px border-radius (pill shape). 10-12px vertical padding × 20px horizontal padding. Fill is white. Border 1px solid Ink Black. Placeholder text is ppsupply weight 300 at 15px in Pencil Gray (#a1a0a0). Focus state thickens or darkens the border to 2px Ink Black; no glow or ring.

### List Row
**Role:** Navigation menu items, palette member listings, or directory rows

Full-width row with 8px vertical padding. Sage Wash (#dde5d8) or white fill. 1px Ink Black border separates rows. Text is ppsupply weight 300 at 15-18px. Tight rhythm with no extra vertical air — lists feel like notebook entries.

### Display Wordmark
**Role:** Hero text — the single 64px statement that names the page or section

esbuild weight 400 at 64px. Line-height 0.94 (nearly touching). Letter-spacing -0.03em (-1.92px). Text color is Ink Black (#141212). No all-caps; set in lowercase or sentence case. Sits alone on the cream canvas, often centered, with no supporting decoration.

### Swatch Set Card
**Role:** Curated palette container — a group of 4-6 related swatches presented as a unit

White or Studio Ivory (#d7d7c8) fill, 12px border-radius, 20px padding. Contains 3-6 smaller swatch rectangles inside, each at ~60-80px with 8px gaps. Title in ppsupply weight 300 18px sits above. Functions as the purchasable/downloadable unit.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Set all page backgrounds to Studio Cream (#f2f0e9); never use pure white as a full-page background
- Use esbuild at exactly 64px for display headings with -0.03em letter-spacing and 0.94 line-height — one word should command the page
- Use ppsupply at weights 100 or 300 for body copy; reserve weight 400 for interactive elements and emphasis
- Use 12px border-radius for all cards, swatches, and images; 5px for rectangular buttons; 100px for pill buttons, tags, and inputs
- Wrap all interactive elements (buttons, inputs, cards) in a 1px solid Ink Black (#141212) border — this is the system's only structural line
- Use Cobalt Command (#3051a8) exclusively for primary actions, active links, and icon accents — never as a background fill or large surface
- Vary swatch rectangle dimensions deliberately — tall narrow strips, wide short bands, small squares — to create gallery rhythm rather than uniform grid tiles

### Don't
- Don't add drop shadows, blurs, or frosted-glass effects — the design is intentionally flat and relies on color and borders for separation
- Don't use system sans-serifs (Arial, Helvetica, SF Pro) for body text — always ppsupply; the custom font's light weights define the airy feel
- Don't use multiple saturated colors as UI chrome — chromatic colors are swatch content, not interface elements
- Don't center content in a max-width container for the whole page — let the swatches scatter full-bleed; the canvas is the layout
- Don't use white card fills on the cream canvas unless elevation is needed — default to Studio Ivory (#d7d7c8) for palette cards
- Don't set display text in all caps; esbuild's geometric character works in lowercase or sentence case where letterforms stay distinct
- Don't use gradient fills, even subtle ones — every surface in this system is a single solid color

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 0 | Canvas | `#f2f0e9` | The full-bleed page background; warm cream ground |
| 1 | Paper | `#ffffff` | White cards and elevated content blocks |
| 2 | Studio Ivory | `#d7d7c8` | Neutral swatch surface — the standard card body for palette displays |
| 3 | Sage Wash | `#dde5d8` | Tinted surface for tags, list items, and secondary buttons |

## Elevation

This design is intentionally shadowless. Depth is communicated exclusively through color contrast and hairline 1px borders (most often Ink Black #141212). There are no drop shadows, no blurs, no frosted glass — the flatness is deliberate and reinforces the paper/stationery metaphor. Surfaces separate by tone, not by lift.

## Imagery

The site has essentially no traditional imagery — no photography, no illustration, no 3D renders. The visual content IS the color: flat rectangular swatches of varying sizes and aspect ratios scattered across the warm cream canvas like paint chips on a studio table. Swatches are sharply edge-defined (no shadows, no rounded content within), 12px-cornered, and presented as raw color blocks rather than styled cards. Icons (when present) are line-style with 1px strokes in Cobalt Command or Ink Black, monoline, geometric. The visual density is very low — most of the page is breathing cream space, with color appearing as deliberate, curated punctuation.

## Layout

Full-bleed warm cream canvas with no hard container width; content floats as scattered elements rather than confined to a centered column. The hero is minimal: a single large display wordmark (esbuild 64px) centered or left-aligned on the open canvas, with color swatches distributed asymmetrically around it at varying scales. Below the hero, palette sets appear as loose groups of swatch rectangles rather than a rigid grid — positions feel curated, not algorithmic. Navigation is minimal: likely a top-right cluster of text links, no sticky header, no sidebar. The overall rhythm is gallery-like — generous 72px vertical gaps between sections, each section reading as one composed arrangement rather than stacked blocks. No alternating dark/light bands; the entire page lives in the light cream world.

## Agent Prompt Guide

**Quick Color Reference**
- Canvas/background: #f2f0e9 (Studio Cream)
- Card surface: #ffffff (Paper White) or #d7d7c8 (Studio Ivory)
- Primary text: #141212 (Ink Black)
- Muted text: #a1a0a0 (Pencil Gray)
- Border/divider: #141212 at 1px
- primary action: #3051a8 (filled action)

**3-5 Example Component Prompts**

1. **Display heading**: Set text in esbuild, 64px, weight 400, color #141212, letter-spacing -0.03em, line-height 0.94. Set on #f2f0e9 canvas. No other elements on the line.

2. Create a Primary Action Button: #3051a8 background, #ffffff text, 9999px radius, compact pill padding. Use this filled treatment for the main CTA.

3. **Color swatch card**: A flat rectangle, 12px border-radius, no border, no shadow. Fill is a single solid color (e.g. #3f593d or #c7b8ab). Dimensions vary — use 180×240, 320×160, or 120×120, scattered across the cream canvas with 24-48px gaps between.

4. **Pill filter tag**: Background #dde5d8, text #141212 in ppsupply weight 300 at 15px, padding 8px 20px, border-radius 100px, border 1px solid #141212. Group 3-5 tags horizontally with 8px gaps.

5. **Email capture input**: White fill, border 1px solid #141212, border-radius 100px, padding 12px 20px. Placeholder in ppsupply weight 300 at 15px, color #a1a0a0. Adjacent submit button is the Cobalt Command rectangular button described above.
