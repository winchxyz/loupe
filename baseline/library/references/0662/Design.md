# Kit — Style Reference
> Warm creator notebook — parchment pages, highlighter-blue ink, heavy type on linen.

**Theme:** light

Kit reads like a warm editorial notebook — cream-tinted parchment (#f2efe9) as the page base, heavy black headlines punching out of it at weight 700, and a single sky-blue accent (#44b1ff) that appears on CTAs and interactive highlights against the near-black (#1e1e1e). The palette is intentionally muted and hand-curated: soft pastel blocks (dusty blue, blush pink, peach, sage green) appear as section backgrounds, never as text or interaction states, making the one vivid blue feel like a highlighter on a notebook page. KitSansFont at 80px/64px in the custom weight 500 dominates hero spaces with tight -0.009em tracking, while Libre Franklin handles everything else across the content hierarchy — a two-font system where custom display and workhorse utility stay in clearly assigned lanes. Radius tokens are tight and intentional: 12px on buttons and cards, 8px on secondary UI, creating a slightly-rounded-but-serious personality that avoids both sharp corporate rigidity and bubbly consumer softness.

## Tokens — Colors

| Name | Value | Token | Role |
|------|-------|-------|------|
| Sky Marker | `#44b1ff` | `--color-sky-marker` | Primary CTA buttons, active nav states, inline keyword highlights — vivid blue on parchment or near-black backgrounds acts as the single highlighter across an otherwise neutral palette, directing attention without competing with any other chromatic element |
| Dust Blue | `#a2d1f1` | `--color-dust-blue` | Hero and section background panels — muted blue used as an atmospheric backdrop, never for text or interaction |
| Blush Mist | `#e7c9f1` | `--color-blush-mist` | Section background panels — pastel pink used decoratively to vary section rhythm |
| Peach Sand | `#ffd0ad` | `--color-peach-sand` | Section background panels — muted orange for alternating content band backgrounds |
| Sage Foam | `#b9e9c5` | `--color-sage-foam` | Section background panels — muted green used as a decorative surface, never for semantic status |
| Amber Flag | `#f2ba41` | `--color-amber-flag` | Icon fills and inline callout elements — warm yellow used sparingly for small graphic accents, not for text or backgrounds |
| Near Black | `#1e1e1` | `--color-near-black` | Primary text, nav text, button text, footer text, borders on dark surfaces — near-black rather than pure black softens the contrast ceiling while still reading as definitive ink |
| Parchment | `#f2efe9` | `--color-parchment` | Page background, hero section fill, card backgrounds — the defining warm-tinted base that makes the whole site feel like a printed editorial page rather than a screen |
| Chalk | `#ffffff` | `--color-chalk` | Card interiors, form inputs, modal surfaces, footer text on dark backgrounds |
| Fog | `#e3e3e3` | `--color-fog` | All borders, dividers, input outlines — omnipresent at freq=7844, it is the connective tissue border color across every component |
| Ash | `#d4d4d4` | `--color-ash` | Subdued body text, placeholder text, disabled states |

## Components

### Primary CTA Button
**Role:** Main call-to-action — 'Start free trial', sign-up triggers

Background #44b1ff, text #1e1e1, border-radius 12px, padding 16px all sides. Font: Libre Franklin 600 14-16px. No border. On parchment (#f2efe9) backgrounds this creates the single chromatic pop on an otherwise neutral surface. Appears 9× as the dominant button variant.

### Ghost Navigation Button
**Role:** Secondary nav actions like 'Log in', 'Request a demo', dropdown triggers

Background transparent, text #1e1e1, border-radius 0px, no padding (inline text-style). Libre Franklin 400-600 14px. Border inherited as #e3e3e3 only when grouped. Used for non-CTA nav links that need no chrome — they read as text until hovered.

### Subtle Tinted Button
**Role:** Tertiary or grouped option buttons within content

Background oklab dark-tinted at ~8% opacity (#1e1e1 at 0.08), text #1e1e1, border-radius 8px, zero padding (tight fit). Creates a very-light pressed-surface appearance against parchment. Appears 4× as an in-content control variant.

### Text Action Button
**Role:** Inline content actions, pill-style small controls

Background transparent, text #1e1e1, border-radius 8px, padding 4px top/bottom × 8px left/right. Libre Franklin 400 14px. Minimal-chrome button for low-emphasis actions within content blocks.

### Hero Feature Card
**Role:** Below-the-fold 4-column feature summary tiles

Background #ffffff on parchment page, border 1px #e3e3e3, border-radius 12px, padding 24px. Contains a colored icon (Amber Flag #f2ba41 or Sky Marker #44b1ff), Libre Franklin 700 14-16px bold feature name inline with body weight 400 description. Light card on warm page base creates subtle lift without shadows.

### Pastel Section Background Band
**Role:** Full-bleed section backgrounds used to break page rhythm

Full-width bands using Dust Blue #a2d1f1, Blush Mist #e7c9f1, Peach Sand #ffd0ad, or Sage Foam #b9e9c5. No border, no radius (edge-to-edge). Text remains #1e1e1 throughout — contrast is always AAA (12:1+). Each band houses product screenshots or feature illustrations, never more than one pastel per consecutive section.

### Navigation Bar
**Role:** Sticky top navigation across all pages

Background #f2efe9 (parchment), height ~56px, border-bottom 1px #e3e3e3. Left: Kit wordmark #1e1e1e. Center: ghost text nav items (Features, Pricing, Use Cases, Resources) Libre Franklin 600 14px. Right: 'Log in' ghost + 'Request a demo' ghost + 'Start free trial' #44b1ff pill button at border-radius 12px, padding 16px. Entire bar shares the parchment base — no white nav-on-white convention.

### Footer Column Grid
**Role:** Site-wide footer link columns

Background #1e1e1 (near-black), text #ffffff for links, column headers in Libre Franklin 600 10-12px uppercase with 0.025em letter-spacing. Links in Libre Franklin 400 14px #ffffff. 4-column grid with 32px column gap. 'NEW' badge appears as a small Sage Foam #b9e9c5 pill tag inline with select links. Parchment logo (#f2efe9 tinted) in bottom-left.

### Testimonial / Creator Photo Strip
**Role:** Social proof imagery along the hero's right edge

Circular avatar images 40-48px diameter, stacked vertically with 4px gap, border 2px #ffffff. Float against the photographic hero background. No label text — image-only stack creates ambient trust signal without disrupting the headline hierarchy.

### NEW Badge
**Role:** Inline tag marking new features in nav and footer

Background Sage Foam #b9e9c5, text #1e1e1, border-radius 8px, padding 4px 8px. Libre Franklin 600 10px uppercase with 0.025em tracking. Appears inline after link text — not as a standalone badge but as a tight appended label.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use #f2efe9 (Parchment) as the default page background — never pure white (#ffffff) for full-page base
- Apply #44b1ff only to primary CTA buttons and keyword highlights; all other interactive text states use #1e1e1 on transparent
- Set all button border-radius to 12px for primary actions; use 8px for secondary/tertiary controls and form inputs
- Use KitSansFont weight 500 only at 48px and above; switch to Libre Franklin for all text at 20px and below
- Apply 1px #e3e3e3 border to all cards and inputs — no shadows; elevation reads through surface color contrast alone
- Use pastel section backgrounds (Dust Blue #a2d1f1, Blush Mist #e7c9f1, Peach Sand #ffd0ad, Sage Foam #b9e9c5) for alternating content bands; limit to one per section, never consecutive same-hue bands
- Set Libre Franklin at negative letter-spacing: -0.016em at 16px, -0.013em at 14px, -0.025em at 10-12px caps labels with +0.025em for uppercase tags

### Don't
- Don't use #44b1ff as a section background or decorative fill — it exists only on interactive elements (buttons, inline highlights)
- Don't add box-shadows to cards or buttons — shadows break the flat editorial print aesthetic; use border 1px #e3e3e3 instead
- Don't use KitSansFont below 48px in display contexts; at smaller sizes it loses the structural weight that justifies its custom status
- Don't use Amber Flag (#f2ba41) for text, borders, or buttons — it is strictly an icon accent fill color
- Don't stack two consecutive pastel-background sections of the same hue — alternate with parchment (#f2efe9) or white (#ffffff) bands between
- Don't use border-radius above 16px — avoid pill/capsule shapes (9999px) entirely; the system sits between pill-free and boxy
- Don't apply the dark footer (#1e1e1e) surface to any mid-page section — it is reserved exclusively for the page-closing footer block

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 0 | Page Base | `#f2efe9` | Default page and hero background — warm parchment that defines the editorial character |
| 1 | Card Surface | `#ffffff` | Form inputs, content cards, dashboard mockup overlays — reads as lifted against parchment without shadows |
| 2 | Dark Inversion | `#1e1e1` | Footer only — full-bleed near-black surface that closes the page as a strong typographic terminus |

## Elevation

Kit avoids drop shadows almost entirely. Elevation is achieved through surface color contrast: white (#ffffff) cards read as lifted against parchment (#f2efe9), and parchment sections read as recessed against white overlays. The single exception is the UI mockup/dashboard card that floats over photography — it uses the white card surface plus the 1px #e3e3e3 border to visually separate from the photographic background without a shadow. This keeps the design feeling printed and flat rather than glass-and-depth.

## Imagery

Kit uses portrait photography as the hero's dominant visual — waist-up shots of real creators (authors, coaches, bloggers) holding their books or products against solid-color studio backgrounds (teal, blue). The photography is warm, direct, high-key studio lit with no moody processing — subjects look at camera or slightly off, smiling, creating a peer-to-peer feeling rather than aspirational stock. Photos bleed to the card edge with a 12px radius container. Product UI screenshots appear as overlapping card overlays (dashboard metrics, sign-up pages) positioned partially over the photography, grounding the emotional imagery in functional reality. The second-screen hero section uses a darkened product screenshot as a full-panel background with a floating white card overlay — photography mixed with UI, not isolated. The testimonial strip uses tight circular avatar crops. Icon style: filled, minimal, two-tone (Sky Marker blue #44b1ff body + Amber Flag #f2ba41 accent detail), displayed at 24-32px in feature cards. Imagery density is balanced — one large photo per hero, then primarily text + UI screenshot driven below the fold.

## Layout

Max-width ~1200px centered, sections are full-bleed to viewport width with content constrained inside. The above-the-fold hero splits 50/50: left half parchment (#f2efe9) with headline + CTA, right half full-height portrait photography — no gutter between them, creating an edge-to-edge split without a grid column gap. Below the hero: alternating pastel band sections (Dust Blue, Blush Mist, Peach Sand) each containing a centered product screenshot or feature illustration with text alongside. Feature grid: 4-column card row at comfortable 24px padding each. 'Thousands of' social proof section: centered headline with keyword highlighted in Sky Marker #44b1ff, followed by a horizontal creator photo strip. Footer: dark (#1e1e1e) full-bleed 4-column link grid. Navigation is sticky top bar at 56px, parchment-colored matching the hero. Section vertical rhythm is 80px gaps between major bands. No sidebar patterns — all layouts are horizontal-grid or centered-stack.

Privacy note: Libre Franklin 400 12px #d4d4d4 centered below button.

## Pastel Band System

Kit uses four muted pastel hues as interchangeable full-bleed section backgrounds: Dust Blue (#a2d1f1), Blush Mist (#e7c9f1), Peach Sand (#ffd0ad), Sage Foam (#b9e9c5). Rules: (1) Never place two pastel bands consecutively — always break with Parchment (#f2efe9) or White (#ffffff). (2) All four achieve AAA contrast with #1e1e1 text (12:1 minimum). (3) Never use these colors for borders, buttons, or text — surface-only. (4) The Sage Foam (#b9e9c5) shade doubles as the NEW badge fill, the only case where a pastel color appears on a UI component rather than a full section.
